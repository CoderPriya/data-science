Serverless Computing
=====

Create a lambda function that takes three integer variables, `year`, `month`, and `date`, and returns the string representation of that time.  For instance, if your endpoint URL is:

```
https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/convert
```

we should be able to send the following request:

```
https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/sum?year=2019&month=3&date=27
```

which should return:

```
March 27, 2019
```

Submit your endpoint to https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/57068/assignments/215865
