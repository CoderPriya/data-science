## Task

Currently, the `extract_exam_schedule` function does not normalize the class meeting time into military time correctly for afternoon classes.  Update the function such that it shows correct military time for afternoon classes.

* Create a package called `quiz1` under the `qtm385` project.
* Copy [`quiz1.py`](quiz1.py) under the `quiz1` package.
* Add all necessary contents (e.g., packages, constants, functions) to run `quiz1.py` that replicates the results from the class.
* Update the `extract_exam_schedule` function to properly normalize the meeting times for afternoon classes.
* Save the printed output to `quiz1/quiz1.txt`.


## Submission

* Add the `quiz1` package to git:
  * `quiz1/quiz1.py`
  * `quiz1/quiz1.txt`
* Commit and push your changes to Github.
