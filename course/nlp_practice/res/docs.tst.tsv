AA	When my old Sears vac died , I decided to try the Shop-Vac 610 - it looked strong and the stainless steel tank looked like it would last forever . One thing I neglected to check on was POWER . This machine is light duty , and I should have known the small hose size was indicative of its capability - it is not nearly as powerful as the old , noisy Sears unit . If anyone will make me an offer for this unit , I would like to upgrade to something that really performs like a shop vac should .
AA	These bags are the finast vacuum bags ever ....EVER ! So , if you need to vacuum fruitcake out of carpets , floors , or dog houses [where I stash mine ! ]....these bags are for you ! They truly offer superior sucking action [can I say that here ? ] . Seriously , I 've noticed that running my vacuum with these bags takes the cig-smoke out of the air ! Pretty impressive ! ! ! cheers ! SR...pro-reviewer
AA	I needed replacements for my air cleaner . No big deal , right ? Well it should n't have been , but wait till you check the prices for your Holmes air filter replacements . The operating expense of this unit for a year almost equals the initial amount paid for the whole unit . This complaint aside the two pack I got from Amazon is the best pricing I could find . My three star rating is more directed at the idea that Holmes has you over a barrel than the service I received from Amazon which I would have given a five star to .
AA	I 've had an older Jiffy Steamer for about 20 years , and it 's always worked like a champ . I 'm a professional photo stylist , so I use it a lot , and have taken it on many trips , so it 's been shipped just about everywhere . Finally decided to get a newer model , which is much lighter , thus less expensive to ship . I love it , works as great as the last one .
AA	Ive had this fridge for about 3 yrs now - i got this when i was 17 or 18 and it still works great and is worth the money . Its perfect for teenager or college students dorm . Ive had this in the bedroom since then and i have gotten compliments on it and how cool it was and its good to store some drinks and you can have a decent amount of food or other things in there but it is perfect size for the bedroom but inside it is small to medium storage capacity - but for its smallness it is very powerful and keeps drinks and other things ice cold and also comes with a little freezer compartment which is also very powerful- id say it can hold about a case of drinks or case and half and some room for food - its better for storing drinks . But overall good little fridge with lots of power and nice silver design .
AA	Earlier reviews complained about difficulty in finding a button for mulching . I guess they were right ; I could n't find one . The instructions just say the leaves will be mulched as they go through the impeller . After vacuuming a bunch of leaves and dumping them into a recycle bin , I could n't really see any evidence of mulching . The blower and vacuum work very well , however . Do n't make the mistake of trying to vacuum leaves from loose dirt ; you 'll suck up a lot of dirt . Blow the leaves into a pile and then vacuum them . Still , I like this tool . It 's much quieter and easier to use than my gas blower .
AA	I bought many of the OXO Good Grips kitchen gadgets for my wife to replace an assortment of older items that had just lost their looks , and so forth . This stainless slotted spoon as with all of the OXO Good Grips items we bought feels great in your hand , is well made and looks great . I would recommend the OXO Good Grips items to any of my family and friends , as a very nice home kitchen utensils set .
AA	For the reviewers that complained that they needed to go back to the vac to manually turn off the unit when using the "on-demand " feature , you need to return the unit to be repaired . My vac works perfectly when using the on demand feature . It has a delay of about 6 or 7 seconds before shutting off . This delay is a built in feature that allows the hose to clear itself before shutting down . I think most of the problems mentioned in the reviews have come from not reading the instructions ( I must admit , I 'm guilty of this myself from time to time ) . As far as clogging , all vacs with and 1 1/2 " hose will clog from wood chips . I invested in the larger hoses that amazon offers , and they fit perfectly into the vac intake . As far as the tool end connection to the hose , this is where good old yankee ingenuity will help . There are rubber fittings available that are " stepped " in size to accomadate different diameter connections , this item does n't work on all connections , but most . I did have to have the on-demand switch replaced after about 9 months of use ( reason for the 4 stars ) , but other than that this vac has performed extremely well . My main use of the vac is dust collection while being attached to my Bosch orbital sander . It picks up about 95 % of the dust , which is a huge improvement over using the attached cloth bags that come with some sanders . I have several of my shop power tools pre-fitted with vac hoses , and simply wheel the vac from tool to tool when needed . This vac is a great alternative to investing in a dust collection system , and all that goes with it , when you do n't have the room or the budget .
AA	I should qualify my 5 stars , because there 's not a juice extractor on this planet that is perfect -- they all have pros and cons . But the price , quality and convenience of this one makes it a winner . This juicer is similar to , and just as good as , the original Acme/Omega juicers . Sure , the yield on leafy greens is n't the best , but it does carrots , beets & celery as well an any other juicer -- and quickly , too . The yield is far better than the extractors that spit out the pulp right away . I 've been juicing on-and-off for the last decade , and I like that the parts for this juicer store easily while the food processor stays on my counter . BTW , if the juicer starts to rattle or spin , adding another carrot firmly will usually solve the problem .
AA	This attachment is EXCELLENT and doing organic appleasauce couldnt be easier . It 's easy to put together and the results are amazing . I core my apples , and from what I 've been told , that 's not even necessary although I still do it out of habit . Then boil them for a few minutes and drop them into the feed and out comes perfect applesauce . I did well over 20 quarts this year and my kids gobble it up , all organic and sugar free . They REQUEST it for snack ! Thanks KitchenAid ! By the way , this is Brians wife ...lol !
AA	The reason for a low rating is that I did not receive all the parts for a complete unit . I have not been able to use any part of this because I am missing the butterfly that goes on the end of the auger . I have tried to return this . It cost more to send it back and has been a hassle to contact anyone who will listen . Buying from this company is a joke .
AA	Be sure you match up the sizing of your coffee maker before buying this filter . There are many different sizes . For this filter it states directly on the box : Fits Krups coffee Makers Model Numbers : 252 , 466 , 467 , 458 , and 144.. Check out the Krups website just to be sure you have the correct size before placing your order with Amazon. . Filter came as stated . . I just did n't do my research before placeing the order. . re-ordering the correct size . .
AA	My municipal water is so horrible I will have to replace the wick annually . Keeps my 2000 sq ft house at about 40 percent throughout the winter .
AA	We bought this product , as part of our Dr. Weil '8 Weeks to Optimum Health ' regimen . And , we really love it . During the winter , when the bedroom gets so dry , the humidifier really does the trick . And , it may be in our heads , but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house .<p>This product has great air quality ratings ( HEPA , etc. ) relative to other products in its price range , and was easy to set up , etc.<p>Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean . You need to take it all apart , etc . However , this may be the case with all of these products , and thus , may just be par for the course .<p>We recommend this product whole-heartedly .
AA	I loved the tray that came with my Nesco Dehydrator so much ; I had to have four more ! I buy a lot of fruit for my kids to eat , and I used to throw away a lot of fruit that would over ripen before they could eat it all (especially bananas ) . Once I got my dehydrator , I started making Fruit Leathers with the leftovers . my kids actually preferred it to the fresh fruit ! All I do is remove the peel from any fruit that is past its peak , throw it in the food processor , liquefy it , scoop it onto the Clean-A-Screen Tray and place it in the dehydrator . When it is dry I take the tray out- and give it to my kids to peel and place in airtight bags - they usually eat it all and never put any in bags ! I have even used it as " treat when you finish your homework ! " Can you believe that - they are eating fruit with no sugar added and think it is a special treat ! AWESOME! ! ! !
AA	I have no problems with the Foodsaver rolls ... those seem to work flawlessly . These pre-made bags , however , have been next to worthless . Perhaps I just received a bad batch but only about one out of every 5 bag will even begin to evacuate much less hold a seal . Those that do evacuate typical lose their seals after a while . I 'm sticking with the rolls from now on . One positive is that I can use the box these came in to store bags I 've made from the rolls for later reuse . Other than that , these bags have been frustrating in the extreme !
AA	I love this mixer . It is SOOO powerful ! I got one for my mother-in-law too .
AA	I have used the Hamilton Beach 05910 Humidifier for several years . The filters last a long time providing you use them as directed . I have been very satisfied with this product and with Amazon 's price and timely delivery .
AA	This humidifier is loud , the white noise could be soothing to some , but annoying for other people . The reason I am rating this with a 2 because it leaked a HUGE puddle of water the second night I used it . I returned this humidifier and went with theFuijitronic FB-602 Ultrasonic Humidifier with Built-in Ionizer and have n't had a single problem . Our toddler also loves the little bear design .
AA	Excellent product as far as portability . Love the wall mount feature , long cords also making using it an ease . Suction tube is too narrow and is susceptible to clogging . Otherwise an excellent product .
AA	This product was smaller than I had antisipated and the lid does n't fit as securely as other 's I have . One thing I do n't like about it is there are no type of handles and makes it very difficult and dangerous when removing from the oven when it is extremely hot .
AA	I , too , was hesitant about spending this much $ $ to make milkshakes ; however , the kids love to make shakes and the standard blender is hard for them to clean ( not to mention the sharp blades ) . After our first use , my 15-year-old son said that he was "Ecstatic ! " . Anyone with teenagers knows how hard it is to achieve an emotional response--normally I get a monosyllabic grunt .
AA	This company keeps making the containers full knowing that they will crack on the bottom . Some legal action needs to be taken against this fraud . Do n't buy anything from them
AA	I know many of you seen reviews about this product leaking , thats all bogus this is a great product . First of all the lid is so tight it took me like 5 minutes just to get it on , from time i saw that i knew it was n't going to leak i use it to mix my protein shakes and those little blades help to break all the clumps . So if you guys looking for a good protein shaker this is the one .
AA	When I ordered this item , it never stated that it worked with a mixer . Well I do not have the mixer that goes with this ice cream maker . It did not come this all items that it stated it came with . I think it would work fine if you had the mixer that worked with it . I also think the item has been used before .<br>Thank you<br>Michael A. Velto
AA	The Dirt Devil Vaccuum Cleaner bags arrived in excellent condition . I was happy to get them as I have n't been able to find them in the local stores . Thanks for the prompt order .
AA	I needed a little hand mixer for the little jobs and this does the little jobs well ! I use the kitchen aid for mixing cookies and other types of dough .
AA	The reviews are exactly as it is . If you are noise sensitive there are models that are better out there . This has a nice look but makes a high pitch noise . Other small fridges have a lower noise level . Beware if noise is a concern . Its not so loud as it is a high pitch .
AA	and have been more than happy with it . It is , I think , the low end of the Kitchenaid mixers , much like the classic . But I also think , from all the reviews I have read that this one will out do and out last the pricier and admittedly prettier Artisian series . I am not an uber baker , so I cannot say how long this would last if I baked everyday . With a little care I think a long time . The directions are very clear about what speeds to use and what amount of specific flours that should be used to ensure that the motor can handle the work . I do make more bread now than I used to , the ease of letting the mixer knead for 10 minutes while I am free to do other things in the kitchen is wonderful . Also for those big holiday meals this takes the work out of everything from baking to mashing potatos . Highly recomended .
AA	I recieved this product wrapped in newspaper , and it smelled . Beware if not purchasing from amazon.com . I also purchased the three layer flat filter from amazon - arrived perfectly .
AA	This is my first immersion blender , but I am impressed with its capabilities so far . I do like the multi-speed options and it seems to be a sturdy little instrument . The packaging , however , is a crime against the earth ! ! I would never have bought it , had I known that it came sandwiched between two huge nonbiodegradeable slabs of styrofoam . This aspect of the product seriously brings down its star rating in my book . Amazon , you too , put on an offensive packaging show . The KitchenAid box was packed in a huge box , many times larger than the purchased product , and stuffed with non-recyclable plastic . :(
AA	I followed the advice of others who reviewed this product in much greater detail ( thank you guys ) . Was going to buy a Dyson - think I saved a lot of money !
AA	I 'm a big fan of upright cordless vacuums for daily pickup of dog hair and dust bunnies on our tile and wood floors . These guys ca n't replace the power of a regular corded vac on carpets but are nice to have around for easy inbetween jobs on hard surfaces . After our old Eureka Boss died which we absolutely loved after a long life , we found they 're not made anymore so decided to try this one . It 's more powerful than the usual cordless uprights but is a pain to use . It shuts off if stood upright ( it 's supposed to ) and is very heavy to manouver around or get up and down a stair or two . The cannister fills up quickly . On the plus side , it 's better on rugs and carpets than the usual uprights . Not great , but good enough . For us , it 's not practical as one of the beauties of having a cordless is that the kids can help out with some easy vacuuming or I just whizz around for a quick pick-up . This model is too heavy for my children ( 8 & 11 ) to move from room to room where there are 2 stairs and they bang it on my hardwood floor accidentally as they try to lift it . It 's also too heavy for me as I have to be careful of my back . This model will be relegated to our basement which is just one big open area as I search for another lighter weight model . If my back was stronger , we had less furniture to manouver around , no steps , and more storage space for housing the big charger and big vacuum , I might like this model . But as such , it 's just not a very convenient tool to use in our house for a quick clean except in our open floored basement . I 've given it 3 stars as the suction is better than the usual cordless uprights . We have another new one at the office ( different brand to this ) and that one is pretty useless . The wand is a nice touch too for when you need it . But otherwise , too heavy and cumbersome for our type of house . And the automatic switch offs are a pain when you just want to whizz through the house quickly .
AA	This Hoover Floormate gets the job done , however if you have a larger hardwood/tile floor surface I would suggest spending more on the floormate with rotating brushes . Mine is over two years old and still works great but do plan on upgrading soon . No problems at all with it . Just need to change the filter every few months .
AA	I have purchased many humidifiers over the last 10-15 years as I have chronic sinus problems that are exacerbated by dry winter air . As you research the ratings of these appliances - you see that ALL models from ALL brands have glaring problems in their designs . I like the styling and feature set of the Bionaire brand - I have purchased 3 in total ... the model I liked best is no longer made - but i thought i would give these a try ----- If you have even remotely hard water and if you do n't want to be constantly replacing MOLDY wicking elements ----avoid this style of humidifier technology . They are terrible . And it is not Bionaire 's fault - all brands fall prey to the fundamental flaw of this approach to humidity . A wad of paper soaking in water all day/all night . It 's a shame because the Galileo remote hygrometer/control unit is very well thought out and the looks of these units are great . It 's just that wicking humidifiers are fundamentally the wrong approach . So until somebody make a wick that is impervious to both mineral deposits AND mold/mildew ... do n't waste your money . I liked my old warm mist Bionaire and I am considering one again . There is still a scale problem there , but it seems the least annoying of all the humidifier technologies in terms of performance , maintenance and byproducts like mold , white dust or scale . As for Bionaire - I feel there products are well built , smartly designed , attractive , acceptably quiet , and built to last a long time . I just do n't find the wick approach to be at all intelligent . too bad - maybe another model . Will let you know .
AA	In my handyman business , a small powerfull vac is a must . I 've had several Dirt Devils , tried Oreck 's Power Brush , and sent it back , because it , like the Dirt Devil handhelds are toys ; their motors are wimpy . After trying the Vac n' Blo , I finally found a vac that is n't a toy , yet it 's so quiet , you do n't think it 's going to have good suction , but it does - enough to run the optional power rug brush , which the Dirt Devil could n't do without a belt powered by the motor . Why less than perfect ? No attachment storage , and wheels would help , but they make you pay extra for that . But in the end , if you want a compact vac that 's not a wimp , this baby is for you .
AA	Just wanted to warn folks that Amazon 's dimensions info is incorrect . Do not go by their 10 " x 9 " description , as this top is considerably smaller . I 'm thinking these are the dimensions for the 2-1/2 quart version . Other than that , the top is perfectly fine and it 's nice that replacements are available .
AA	The product is fine . What I was impressed with was Amazon 's response when the product initially arrived in about 5 pieces . Using the online site I was able to get a replacement sent almost immediately at no cost . I am very appreciative of such a service-oriented company .
AA	Where do you get wicks ? I 've been looking all over and Amazon does n't even stock it ... Makes it kind of useless after a while ...
AA	I bought a 12 cup , two 8 cup , and 4 two cup Anchor Hocking glass storage containers . They would be terrific if the lids/containers were level . Instead , the lids teeter-totter on top of the containers , on some as much as 1/4" . Some are better than others , but none of them fit right . I will not purchase another Anchor Hocking product that is made in China ( like these were ) and/or without being able to examine them in person first .
AA	If you run this item on high for 4-5 hours & stick your nose up to the vent you MAY detect a odor of menthol ....maybe .
AA	Have had previous versions due to its great suction/cleaning . Have 2 dogs and 2 todlers/babies , with one of them alergic to dog hair , thus need great cleaning . This provides . Prior versions had issues with durability in the hose connections and had replaced several times due to wearing out as you disconnect and reconnect often for using tools . This one has a telescoping wand with a singular release and seems much more durable in the above problem area . Only negative is that it lost a feture where you could turn down the suction by letting other air in and without this it makes doing things like drapes or small rugs much harder .
AA	I 've used non-stick cookware for many years , including Calphalon 's three top brands and this is the BEST.
AA	This humidifier is completly over priced ( no matter where you purchase ) . On the lowest setting , you are supposed to get 24 hours , but you get 12 at best . It 's also obnoxiously loud . Yes , it humidifies the room , but there are plently of other humidifers out there that are worth the $ you pay for them . I should have done my research before purchasing this one .

AB	It is one of the good book I read eventhough the writer used more technical words that may not be easy for lay man .
AB	really well thought out book , explaining the different training zones inherent in our physiology and how they relate to practical methods of utilizing them to train better and understand the need for recovery and useful training levels .
AB	This book is wonderfully informative , plus it has so many full-color reproductions--the type of terrific catalog that inspires one to stroke its pages with a sense of seduction ( works in my mind ! ) .
AB	Not very memorable , honestly , even though I 'm a staunch liberal myself . Pick it up if you want a bit of light reading that agrees with your political views , but if that 's not your cup of tea , you may want to pass on this .
AB	Though not as good a book as the author 's " Imperial Grunts " this sequel is a very well-done work . As in the previous book , Kaplan visits U.S. military outposts , large and small , around the world , describing the quiet and usually effective efforts our elite troops are executing to keep peace and prepare , if necessary , for war . As another reviewer noted , this is primarily a military travelogue and Kaplan , who I believe is one of the premier travel writers of this or any other time , winnows out the fascinating and the exotic as he writes about the various U.S. posts and the troops who man them . Some of the chapters are very compelling , such as the one describing the "pilots " of the unmanned Predators , the one describing the B-2 bomber pilots , the submarine crews , the green berets and so on . All in all , a fine account of today 's military culture and the many ways we are waging -- overtly and covertly -- the Global War on Terrorism and wars to come .
AB	I learned a great deal from this book . I knew much about the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II--I learned much more . I also knew a lot about WWII combat in Europe--I learned much more . I did not know much about the 442nd Regimental Combat Team . It should not be a surprise that I learned much about it , but , as I said , I learned many other things too . I doubted some of the facts presented , but I checked the most important one and found that it is true--21 Japanese-Americans were awarded Medals of Honor from World War II action . Because that fact was correct , I did not check most of the others . I am an old artilleryman . I had never before read of units being resupplied with critical supplies ( morphine and other drugs , small arms ammo ) via artillery fire . I am still amazed by this , but until I can disprove it , I must believe ( and admire ) it . I did not give a five star rating because of the long description at the end of the book where the author brings in many different ways to prove the incompetence of government and military leaders in creating the internments . Some of this was interesting and worthy , but most had been well-demonstrated by that point in the book . I am a better person for having read this book .
AB	This is great if you want to get together with friends and ask question the questions are not extremely hard it just take logical thinking , it seems easy but some of it can really confuse you . So it 's a buy , and very cheap now .
AB	It was great to be able to come across this old classic again ; I guess most people of today have never heard of this book , which was one of a series , like the Bobbsey Twins ...my mom used to read this 5 Little Peppers book to me when I was little . It is an excellent book for children because it gives them an idea of the way people lived a century ago . Buy it ! Your young ones will like it !
AB	This book was as interesting as always . Mary Higgins clark is a great writer and her books have not disappointed me yet .
AB	This is an interesting book I 'd found at the library , and ordered it on Amazon as soon as I could . It tells four different stories per page , and you have to figure out which story goes where , and when each one starts and ends , and how they 're all connected somehow . I really like this one more than the children do . It 's too illogical for most of them . I find that I can follow the connection between the stories better with each reading . It is one of my 10 favorite children 's books of all time .
AB	A year ago I was asked by a manager to learn basic T-SQL. Primarily joins . I bought a shelf full of books including some in a series designed for "dumb " folk . I struggled trying to understand the vernacular in all of them and grew frustrated because I was n't able to find a single book that took me from " square one " . Without exception , all other books I saw were written to an audience with previous exposure to SQL. Then I read the introduction to this book and saw myself reflected there . Someone else who started one day not knowing anything beyond the fact that something called SQL was out there . This book provides a simple path to follow , written in terms easy to understand and based on sequential levels of learning . Working through each lab takes you from the basic " select * " statement to robust code , helping you understand the logic as you progress . I have finally found a book for the true novice . A book where I feel , " Okay , I can do this . " Instead of , " What ? " The only thing better than working through the book is taking the class with the author as your instructor .
AB	What Really Causes AIDS is a blueprint for preventing AIDS , based on a new model of how HIV-1 causes this disease . This is a plan for stopping the AIDS pandemic.<p>Dr. Foster pretty much demolishes the HIV/AIDS establishment by calling out , " Ladies and Gentlemen , please bark up *this* tree instead . "<p>Highly recommended . See also Dr. Foster 's What Really Causes Schizophrenia .
AB	I really enjoyed this 2nd helping of chicken soup . Every story reaches out to you and you can relate closely to so many . In fact , one story in particular was very , very touching . It made both my husband and me cry . It was a story about a dog that meant alot to a woman and her experiences with that dog and then the sad end to the dog 's life . Well , it just so happened that I read that story to my husband on the eve of our one year anniversary of losing our family dog of thirteen years . It was so like our experience that it sent a shiver down your spine and finally we both cried . It was as if our dog was saying hi to us in his own way , that we had n't forgotten him . Anyways , I love all the stories in your books . I 've read Chicken Soup and now a 2nd helping . So , now I am reading Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover 's Soul . I ca n't wait to read them all ! ! Thank you soooooo much for these wonderful books to read .
AB	The title says it all : Can you stand to be blessed ? T.D. Jakes tells about going through " the storm " and how to overcome it with faith . If you 're going through something and you do n't understand why , do n't see your way out of it , T.D. Jakes explains why we go through what we go through and reassures you there is light at the end of that long tunnel ...It 's God 's blessing ! Can YOU stand to be blessed ?
AB	Dragon Mountain has to be one of the BEST AD&D adventures ever to be made , together with Temple of Elemental Evil , Tomb of Horrors , Castle Greyhawk , and Desert of Desolation ! The adventure is divided into three parts , with each making use of its own respective booklet and set of maps . It deals with a whole mountain that used to be the home to clans of dwarves , but has now fallen under the control/command of an ancient , powerful and very evil Red Dragon and his kobold armies . The kobolds are divided into clans , with their own politics , alliances , and rivalries . Their vast network of spies , limitless intrigue , extensive use of traps and poison , and assortment of resident monsters , make up for a formidable adversary indeed , that will surely win you over if a good challenge is what you are looking for ! There seems to be no end to adventure whether inside or outside Dragon Mountain .<br>As a result , I have had endless hours of gaming enjoyment playing on material presented within the pages of this super-adventure !<br> In short , if you enjoy a good dungeon crawl that also requires a lot of planning beforehand , as well as getting involved in the world of clan politics and their web of intrigue and deceit , try and get your hands on a copy of Dragon Mountain . You 'll never see kobolds in the same light ever again ! Trust me !
AB	I 've found the 30-minute body relaxation exercise to be a great stress relief on my way to work or when lying in bed . Having listened to the CD regularly for the past few weeks , I am finding that it is making a profound difference in my ability to relax . I am so happy to discover that the "relaxation response " , the brain 's response to quiet meditation , is real , and actually reverses the effects of stress . It 's making a bigger difference than I would have imagined . Having experienced increasing stress over the past year , I am so grateful and relieved to find something that helps . Many thanks to the author for her peaceful voice and healing images .
AB	Prostate problems ? Start here ! This book covers it all , from prostate cancer to beneign . It even covers prostate congestion - a subject other books seem to ignore . This book , plus my urologist [he recommended the book ] helped me with my problem which after all the testing came back negative , turned out to be prostate congestion . Please read the book for solutions , advice etc . A must read which could save you a lot of discomfort or even pain .
AB	Take one lovely lady with extrasensory skills , add a wildly attractive alpha male detective , throw in a brutal serial killer and you have the makings of an interesting storyline . Author Linda Howard has a long history of creating original , often riveting , plots in the police procedural/paranormal genre( s ) . Marlie Keen is an "empath . " " She feels others ' emotions so much so that an ordinary drive on a crowded street could make her scream from frustration ...with all these feelings and thoughts bombarding her from every direction . " Marlie often discussed her paranormal abilities with her mentor and friend , Professor Sterling Ewell , head of the Institute of Parapsychology in Bolder CO. Marlie , an exceptionally sensitive "empath " had been tested since she was four years-old . As she got older , with the help of professionals like Professor Ewell , Marlie learned to "block transmissions " so she could function in society . Because she is so sensitive , Marlie has the ability , sometimes , to find people , those who are lost or have been abducted . Six years before this novel begins , there was a series of child kidnappings in Washington State , where Marlie lived . One child had been found dead and two were missing . The local sheriff asked for Marlie 's assistance . Just as she agreed to help , another little boy went missing . Unfortunately the denouement was lethal and traumatic beyond words , as the psycho targeted the psychic , as well as murdered the boy before her eyes . Marlie escaped with her life , barely . She retreated to the Institute of Parapsychology to recover , as much as she possibly could , but is left with recurring nightmares . They will probably never disappear completely , no matter how many years pass . Marlie eventually left the Institute to live in an isolated cabin in the Rockies . Much later , when she felt that she could function again , she moved to Orlando , Florida , the setting for " Dream Man . " She works in a quiet accounting office and keeps to herself , both professionally and socially . She believes that the trauma she suffered six years before had impacted her paranormal abilities in such a way , as to impair them altogether . Perhaps she no longer has the cursed second sight as she has not experienced psychic episodes since her tragic experience in Washington . Marlie actually feels good now , at peace with her daily routine ...until ... While driving home one night , Marlie experiences what feels like a powerful seizure . She is able to pull off the road before she loses consciousness . She experiences a violent murder , as seen through the killer 's eyes . A state trooper finds her in bad shape and follows her home , as she insists she can drive . She collapses inside her front door . Dane Hollister is a detective with the Orlando PD. Yep , he 's the alpha male Bigtime ! ! He is all business , a good cop but a real hard-nose , and he does n't believe in the tooth fairy , Santa Claus or psychics . Hollister is the chief investigator , along with his partner Alejandro Trammell , on the case of a sadistic serial killer - the one Marlie is linked to . When Marlie goes to the police to report her vision - she feels it is her responsibility to do so , even though she knows she is placing herself in an extremely vulnerable position - she is mocked by Detective Hollister , who not only thinks Marlie is a loonie , but thinks she might be a suspect in the case . Otherwise how else would she know the most minute detail of the crime scene ? There 's mega-chemistry between the two . And Hollister is both drawn to and repelled by Marlie . The sexual tension heightens between Marlie and Dane as does the pressure to catch the killer as he escalates the violence with each of his episodes . " Dream Man " is a paranormal thriller , filled with mystery and suspense . It is also an unusual love story . Included here is an issue involving betrayal , which caught me off-guard and left me thinking - something I usually do not do after reading a book of this kind . Since this is a genre novel , I highly recommend it to fans of this type of literature , and to Linda Howard fans in particular . She is at her best here ...well almost her best . Nothing can top " Son of the Morning , " my all time favorite ! ! Jana Perskie Son of the Morning
AB	I am a music therapist in Kansas City and also a mom to a 3 year old and 1 year old . This book gets as much use in the classroom as it does at home ! I teach special needs children ages 3-12 and I have used this book and the accompanying recording in all my classes . Several teachers have purchased the book themselves ! My own children love the songs and and the signs . I get frequent requests at school and at home for the Baby Sing and Sign !
AB	I bought this book for my daughter 's 5th birthday . She enjoys a variety of art forms in a variety of mediums yet she did not comprehend the fact that singing , dancing , banging on a drum , creating a collage , exploring play dough , creating a block structure , and "writing " are all forms of art . After reading this multicultural book , she has a better understanding of art . She now understands that art is more than crayons and paint . She now has a better understanding of creative expression across children of many cultures . The book is an "easy read " for parents and teachers yet can foster more in-depth conversations when needed . I will be sharing this book with my daughters preschool teachers .
AB	Hornby has already proven his mastery of the male ego in High Fidelity and About a Boy . In A Long Way Down he tackles the often taboo topic of suicide and nails it ! A Long Way Down is a work that is nearly impossible to create . At it 's core it 's a book centered around the issue of suicide and getting through life when life is absolutely miserable . However , the book is packed with realistic humor and is anything but depressing ! Hornby also does n't take the easy way out with any of his characters to create a "fairy tale " like book . It 's real , entertaining and all together surprisingly uplifting ! Read it !
AB	What a lousy book . After giving it three tries , I trashed it . The book did n't help me one bit in using VC++ . Coming from intermediate VB6 experience with experience in Win32 Perl programming and a rusty and casual knowledge of the C/C++ language , I was looking for a book that will teach me how to use VC++ IDE. What a waste of time . I hate books like these . You 're in , say , chapter ten and the example application you 're supposed to have done several chapters ago *with the stupid wizard* is needed . First , I do n't want to use the damn wizards . What ever happened to building applications from the ground up ? Anybody can use the wizard . But what about afterwards ? What if you do n't want to ? Second , I do n't care about what was taught several chapter 's ago . I want what 's in the present chapter of interest ! I want to build an interactive UI , like I can do with VB so easily . Perhaps going through ALL the chapters *in sequence* I would have learned *something* . If I were to do that , I might as well take a class instead . I tried the first five chapters in sequence and then tried to skip around and learned that this book [is n't for me] . Look for a another book if you 're the type who likes to use books like a reference guide . If you 're the type who reads cover to cover and do n't mind doing every example and exercise so you can continue onto future chapters , then this book is for you .
AB	This is a wonderful comprehensive book with sensible information based on medical research , presented in a reader friendly format. .
AB	A very good beginning encyclopedia of earth science . It is great for my ESOL students who need easy reading material .
AB	I recently purchased this book about a month ago , and I was very pleased with the quality of the photographs this book had . I was also surprised that some of the producers featured in the book had a lot smaller set ups than I imagined . So , it 's actually good for the up and comers , that are on a budget to see that , just because you do n't have million dollar equipment , does n't mean you ca n't make million dollar records . -David Grants .
AB	This amazing story is full of fasinating word pictures that transport the readers to Hawaii and feel like they were really there during a tsunami . The loss of Kimo 's granfather was heartbreaking , but readers will realize that they can survive the pain of such a loss and keep special memories .
AB	I was given a copy of this book for my birthday several years ago and spent hours pouring over its prose and its historical narratives . I never grow tired of this book . Credit for this work goes to its author who has accomplished the near to impossible - an engaging and personal history of Washington DC told through the destroyed architecture and the people behind the buildings and their creation . The illustrations are gorgeous , but its Goode 's way with worlds that allows the reader to lose themselves in the history of the buildings profiled . I would imagine that this type of book in the wrong hands would become an academic tome , dry and technical . Goode brings the people of the District to life for the reader , and compels the reader to look for more . If the book fails , it is in the lack of a comprehensive map of the whole District of Columbia . If you are not familiar with the streets and layout of the city ( itself genius ) then the book can be confusing . Ideally , I would suggest this as a gift to anyone interested in history , city planning , government or historical architecture .
AB	It came in quickly and we appreciate it .
AB	This book was called " Little Things Matter " when it was in hardcover . At any rate , I think many people overlook the fact that Brillstein was one of the most successful managers and producers in that snake pit called Hollywood , with a career spanning 50+ years . And he did n't have to be a prick to do it . He learned a lot along the way , and this book ( and his other - Where Did I Go Right ? : You 're No One In Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead ! . ) are a concise sharing of the experiences . ( He passed away not long ago on August 7 , 2008 ) . Much of what he relates are useful in any business - I 'm a consultant , and saw many personal business experiences in his anecdotes - in fact , a few gave me some new insights on what I thought at the time were just rather odd situations . Like any memoir , it 's unique to the person and their times . But one has to wonder - was Brillstein the last of a generation ( mature , professional , not totally self-absorbed and with some principles ) - or did he set the example for another generation to follow ? He certainly put his signature on a lot of people . Food for thought .
AB	there are so many books on ww 2 itself as well as individual battles fought in ww 2. for the novice or a person who wants a general overview of this war should start here . the book starts off with the end of the first war and the build up of the second world war . it touches on key battles and a few lesser known ones . the book ends with how nations are rebuilding and US and USSR start an arms race - basically starting the cold war . overall this book is terrific ! a must !
AB	For me , this book was really , really helpful . Let me outline a few things that I found great about this book : 1 ) The non-boring way that the author incorporates statistics into every day life . It gives a personal feel and does n't make you fall asleep ! 2 ) Unbelievably , the glossary ! It 's nice to review . 3 ) Excel complements , so that you can actually be practical and learn statistics with a computer as well as by hand . 4 ) Great organization ! It 's very easy to follow . 5 ) Difficulty level of learning is low , but the difficulty level of the material is fairly high . You learn lots of things with half the effort . There are also , at the ends of each chapter , practice questions that really help out . Once you 're through all of them , and there are n't THAT many , you memorize everything in the chapter without having to physically ( or mentally ) memorize them . Great book ! I highly recommend it .
AB	Just 3 words for you :<p>Buy this book !<p>It has new races , Prc 's , spells , feats and a good description of what it 's like to be a fairie . The layout and art are above standard ( as we are used to getting from Bastion Press : )) .<br>So , I can only repeat myself :<p>Buy this book !
AB	Bought this cause im a big fan of this series and cant wait for the other books to published was kinda hoping that they have an unabridged version so i remain to wait for it .
AB	This book has a wealth of information about tried and tested alternative medications . A great way to save money in a distressed economy .
AB	I read this book two years ago . Out of the blue , I decided to write a review . It is the first time I read the reviews on this book on Amazon . I must say that I am surprised at how many do n't like this book . Not everyone have time to read a dry 800 page book of the official history of France and another 800 page book of the social history of France and another 200 page Paris tourist guide book , so as a substitute , this 400 page of a fun history of Paris book seems like a great deal . For a introduction to France 's history , a history of Paris would certainly be sufficient because many things that you see in Paris can be linked to parts of history . Examples : description of Paris ' city plan in Roman times reminds us that France used to be "occupied " by the Romans . Then there is the Revolution , the crowning of Napoleon , the defeat of Napolean by the Germans , the Nazi occupation ... The additional benefit of relating a historical event to a specific Parisian street/architecture/artifact in Paris is that it helps reader to remember the event better than just reading a history book . Now , if you read a pure history book , you probably wo n't learn about where is the bar that the students and artists used to drink , where the jugglars used to perform , where the rich people used to live , where the prostitues used to linger . There probably would be less detailed description of the lifes of famous French actresses , the circumstances under which the numerous bridges across the Seine were built , when did postal service begin in Paris . There are also references to famous French writers , painters and architects for those are into the arts/literature . ( maybe a little less references to musicians than I 'd like ) I personally have a sort of interesting relationship with Paris . I must have been there 7 times , but have had only two short stints as a proper tourist instead of being on business . So , I know the streets , historical sites and museums of Paris reasonably well . I know quite well where modren Parisian shops and work . However , for myself at least , this book introduces a different aspect of Paris to me . Instead of just looking at the surface of the city , which is the modern or touristy fascade , I have a deeper sense of the myraid actors , glorious or hideous ones , that has shaped the city . One complain I have about this book is that its map is too small and too unclear . It is a pity . I would love to trace everything the author mention on a map so that I can visit the place next time . Normally , this issue would cause me to reduce the star from 5 to 4.5 , thus 4 . But , given how many people do n't like the book , I have to give it a 5 to stress my point . This book is packed with fun details and informative history . It is organized into short chapters . It was a very quick read for me . I am pretty sure that I will read this book again at some point . (unfortunately , my original book is falling apart )
AB	I really enjoyed reading Jordan 's book Perfect Weight . It is very informative and I learned a great many things about what you should and should not eat . I have been a fan of Jordan 's since reading his book " Patient Heal Thyself" . He is one of most positive and honest people that I know , and will always use his products
AB	This is a most impressive book in every respect . I still cannot get over how beautiful the pictures are and how appropriate the layout of the text is in relation to the pictures . A true treasure . The authors and compilers of this work have accomplished a remarkable thing in creating this book . Every time I open its pages , I learn something new and my faith is edified .
AB	Albatros fighters made up the backbone of the German Air Service in World War I. Most , if not all of Germany 's aces , flew some version of the sleek Albatros craft during their combat careers . The exploits of Albatros aces were so widespread that Osprey Publishing has produced a second volume on Albatros aces , this one authored by Greg VanWyngarden . VanWyngarden 's book differs from the earlier book , written by Norman Franks , in that he covers many of the lesser known Albatros aces not covered previously . Ernst Udet is probably the best known ace described along with the likes of Max Muller , Julius Buckler , Kurt Student , Theodor Rumpel , Kurt Schonfelder , Karl-Emil Schafer and others . VanWyngarden is a gifted author , his text flowing smoothly . He includes several first-person accounts that help give a human flavor to those long-ago dogfights . The text is complimented by 100 black & white photographs , several plan views and 11 pages of color profiles by Harry Dempsey . World War I enthusiasts will want to purchase this book . It compliments and supplements the earlier Franks book with more tales of intrepid aces flying one of the sleekest fighters of the Great War .
AB	My wife is an Registered Nurse and I am a combat veteran . I bought this book for my wife to take on our trip to Hawaii . She could not put it down , and later , neither could I. From both our life experiences , this book rang true and was gripping . Having been written by a Minnesotan made it all the more enjoyable .
AB	A lot of stepfamily books give you one-size-fits-all advice . This book does a wonderful job of showing that stepfamilies are very complex , and there is no cookie-cutter approach to forming them . Authors Cohn and Merkel demonstrate the importance of taking into account each family member 's personality . The authors really connect with you emotionally . They show you that stepfamily issues are very emotionally charged , and that you ca n't discount all the feelings that arise in stepfamilies . They describe all the hard work and emotion that goes into making decisions in a stepfamily . It was very moving for me to read this book . I learned that if you really love someone , and you want to make a stepfamily work , you have to throw out some of the conventional wisdom about families . You ca n't try a cookie cutter approach ; you have to be creative . After reading this book , I went out and bought a present for my husband 's ex-wife !
AB	This book is an outstanding mystery with plot turns as intricate as Byzantium 's court intrigue and with such seamless detail the reader cannot tell what is fiction and what history . I call it amazing because the reader is not only swept into the larger currents of life as the old gods fell to the new but also such minute detail , one is living it with the characters . The pacing is excellent for an exciting read and the sense of place beautifully crafted . I seldom read historical mysteries ; I 'm delighted I made an exception here . Mari Ulmer , Taos , NM

AB	I first came across this book under its previous title " Mayo Clinic on Healthy Weight " several years ago . It 's marvelous food pyramid is based on energy or calorie density . This idea was the main ingredient on my path to losing 80 pounds and restoring my blood sugar level to normal following my diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes . An additional good idea is to apply the energy density principle to your plate by filling it with 50 % non-starchy vegetables , 25 % dense carbs and 25 % protein . Another thing that I do is to use 50 % Kellogg 's All Bran or General Mill 's Fiber One for my breakfast cereal . Energy density is particularly important to your selection of dessert . A half cup of pudding made with nonfat milk and sugar free mix is less than 100 calories . It is equally filling to a large chocolate chip muffin which comes in at 600 calories . Other useful books on energy density are the " Volumetic " series by Barbara Rolls , the " Fit or Fat Target Diet " books by Covert Bailey and Ronda Gates , and " The GI Diet " by Rick Gallop .
BC	OK . All right . That 's what they want to do . Thank you , Andy . Appreciate it . All right . Back to you in the studio . Thank you , Greg . Good advice -- Soledad . All right . Let 's turn to your home now . CNN 's Gerri Willis is just north of New York City , in Hartsdale , New York . Hey , Gerri . Good morning . GERRI Willis , CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITO Hey . Good morning , Soledad . You know , I 'm in a kitchen here that has been recently remodeled . Now , if you are hiring a contractor , the devil is in the details . First off , make sure you ask for a license . You can check them out at the attorney general 's Web site for your state . That 's where they have to file all that stuff . And then you want to make sure you ask for references of any contractor -- general contractors , a subcontractor . You want some references . Make sure that they are not buddies of the contractor . Check out the work , too , of the subcontractors , because it is just as important that the guy doing your floor is as good as the general contractor . Also , we mentioned this before . Do n't pay all at once . You want to put down 10 to 25 percent at the first go , and then slowly pay over time as the major systems of your reno get done , whether that 's electrical or plumbing . Each step , give them a little bit of money along the way , and then hold back a little at the end . It is called retainage ( ph ) . This will give you some power over your contractor if that final punch list is n't finished the way you want it finished . Finally , if you do have a problem , you can take them to court . You do n't have to hire an attorney to get help . You can go to small claims court . It costs $ 30. You 'll present your case yourself in front of the judge , and then you will have some kind of resolution . Now , if you are not getting money back from your contractor that you want , go to that licensing board . They will help nail down that payment from your contractor . But again , it 's only $ 30. Easy enough to do . Cheap enough to do . We 're going to have more on this topic Saturday morning , 9:30 a.m. , on " OPEN HOUSE. " " Ripped Off . " Join us then . All right . We sure will .

Iran once again this week told the world to take a hike and to stop interfering with its nuclear program . And next door , Iraq is caught in a deadly whirlwind of Shia versus Sunni violence . I spoke to Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh just a short time ago . He is in Cairo . He has a story coming out in the new issue of The New Yorker magazine about how the Pentagon is right now in the midst of intensive planning for a bombing campaign against Iran . And joining us now from Cairo , Sy Hersh . The article entitled , " The Redirection . " Sy , let me read one line from it . You wrote , " The Iran planning group has been handed a new assignment , to identify targets in Iran that may be involved in supplying or aiding militants in Iraq . Previously , the focus had been on the destruction of Iran 's nuclear facilities and possible regime change . " Based on all your reporting , how far along are U.S. military plans for a war with Iran ? Well , of course , they 're very far along . They have been studying this forever . They 're constantly redesigning , retooling , but right now , as I wrote , look , it 's pretty obvious what 's going on .
BC	Hi , Nancy , you`re the best . Thank you , dear . What` s your question ? My question is , Richard Millstein , as you were just discussing , the court-appointed guardian ad litem , is supposed to be advocating for Dannielynn` s best interests . Therefore , why is it that he is not demanding DNA testing ? Why is he not advocating on behalf of or in conjunction with everyone ? Well , Cheryl , I think wisely Millstein knows that the jurisdiction over the DNA testing is where the baby is , and that baby is in the Bahamas . All these motions regarding paternity should have rightly been filed down there at the get-go , instead of all this incessant whining in front of the microphone and the camera . Out to you , Sherri in Texas , hi , Sherri . Hi . What` s your question , dear ? Well , I` m curious as to whether Mr. Stern can claim to be her common-law husband , and , therefore , her next of kin ? Oh , interesting . Let` s go out to Godfrey " Pro " Pinder . He is the attorney for G. Ben Thompson . Mr. Pinder , thank you for being with us . GODFREY PINDER , ATTORNEY FOR ANNA` S LANDLOR Thank you . What about the possibility of him being established as a common-law husband ? I think I`ve got Mr. Pinder on the phone . Hi , can you hear me ? Yes , I` m on the line . You`re talking about a common-law husband ? Yes , is it possible that Stern could be considered a common - law husband ? No. He has to be at least seven years with a woman , living in the Bahamas in the house before he can be established as a common-law husband . Well , Mr. Pinder has the answer on the law . Everything else is in flux tonight . At least we`ve got one straight answer . Back out to you , Mike Brooks , former D.C. cop and former fed with the FBI . Why are U.S. law enforcement down in the Bahamas ? That` s a good question , Nancy . Sources close to the investigation that I spoke to today said that two investigators from Florida were here speaking with a doctor . Apparently this doctor , Hubert Menace ( ph ) , is the OB-GYN of Anna Nicole Smith . Now , what they want to know , and the questions they were going to ask this doctor is , what kind of drugs did he prescribe to her before , during and after her pregnancy ? And what this says to me , Nancy , as a former investigator , is , I think some things are starting to come back from the toxicology tests , and they`re now looking to draw a parallel , maybe a link analysis between the death of Daniel and the death of Anna Nicole in Florida . But I tell you what , I` m anxious to hear exactly what they have to say and what they found out from this doctor and if they are able to draw a link between the two , because , keep in mind , we still have a coroner` s inquest on March 26th here in the Bahamas into the cause of death of Daniel . We still do n` t know . That has not been answered as of yet . And there` s supposed to be 30 witnesses appear at this coroner` s inquest . And I can tell you , the chief magistrate here is licking his chops to get Howard Stern on the stand and question him , because he` s the only living person who was in that hospital room when Daniel died .
BC	Well , I asked him point blank , and he - and he danced around , and kind of I - I - you know , he did n` t really deny it , but did n` t talk about it , would n` t talk about it . But I did go through other sources , and I do know that he met her . He hugged her . You know , he got to feed her . He got to burp her . She threw up on him , which is a welcome -you know , it` s the trifecta of - of parenthood . And - and that she actually - I understand from that one witness - took both of her hands and grabbed his cheeks . And I understand it was a seminal moment . I think they`re slowly , real quickly , A.J. , getting her used to him . So I think they know what` s coming down the pike . What an emotional time that must have been . " Access Hollywood "` s Tony Potts in Nassau , in the Bahamas . I - I so appreciate you sharing this story with us tonight . Always a pleasure , A.J. Thank you . Now what may be startling new evidence that Larry Birkhead truly is the father of Anna Nicole Smith` s baby . A facial-recognition company called PhoJoe has created a digital image of what Dannielynn might look like when she turns 18 . And let me tell you , the resemblance between her and Larry Birkhead - startling . With us tonight from Detroit , the director of PhoJoe , Emy Craciunescu ; and the artist who created the composite , Jovay Hayes ( ph ) . Welcome to you both . All right , Emy , last count - I got to tell you , it` s been really hard to keep up - but there are at least five men whose names have been tossed around as the potential father of Dannielynn . What convinced you that Larry Birkhead is the likely daddy of Dannielynn ? Well , based on about 60 photos that we analyzed and just put together - the artist , Jovay Hayes , sitting right here next to me , believes that - as well as I do - that Larry Birkhead is the father , mostly because of the eyes and the ears of Larry Birkhead . Yes , and we`re - we`re looking at a picture of the - the digitally aged photo on the left of what she may look like when she` s 18 , and - and a more recent photo on the right . And I want to take a look now at the eyes . I want to compare the eyes of Birkhead and Dannielynn , like you say . Jovay , it` s said the eyes are the window to a person` s soul . What did you find by comparing the eyes ? He shares a - or , yes , Dannielynn and him share the same eyes . His eyes are wide-set apart , and very similar eye shape . OK . Now from the eyes , let` s go to Howard K. Stern` s eyes to the baby . What did you conclude from this , Emy ? Well , the color is different . His - Howard K. Stern` s eyes are - a kind of a grayish blue , and Dannielynn as well as - as well as Larry Birkhead are like a - a sky blue color . And the shape of Howard K. Stern` s eyes are - are quite different .
BC	Shortly after Saddam Hussein was pulled from his final hiding spot , a six - to eight-foot deep hole in the ground , he was examined by the U.S. military . Poked and prodded and videotaped up close , these images not only humiliated the despot ; they humanized a man once considered untouchable and one of the most ruthless dictators of our times . A tyrant who claimed to be a benevolent leader but who in reality slaughtered tens of thousands of people . Saddam Hussein 's rise to power is soaked in blood . He would not hesitate to eliminate anybody who endangers him . Born into poverty and bred on violence , by some reports Hussein became a killer at 19 when he was ordered by his uncle to murder a party official . In 1959 Hussein and other Ba'ath Party members tried to assassinate the Iraqi prime minister . Wounded in the attempt , Hussein fled the country . In 1963 , he married a cousin . They had three daughters and two sons who would become Hussein 's chief henchmen , Uday and Qusay . Later , a series of coups culminated in the return to power of his Ba'ath Party . CON COUGHLIN , AUTHOR , " SADDA HIS RISE & FALL" : The real importance of Saddam 's role in that coup was establishing in security apparatus that would keep the Ba'ath Party in power . Hussein 's mentor , Ahmed Hassan Bakir , became president . For his loyalty , Hussein was given a position on the Revolutionary Command Council . But he wanted more , and over time he got it . Saddam accumulated power over a period of 10 to 12 years . And I think that , you know , the way that that happens is you evidence considerable charm , you evidence an ability to get things done and even very idealistic and ambitious people begin to side with you . For most of the 1970s , Saddam was the real power behind the throne , and in 1979 the throne was his . Whether the president left office or was pushed out , Saddam Hussein crowned himself leader of Iraq . One of the first orders of business : showing Iraqis , and perhaps the world , just how ruthless and cruel he could be . It is a chilling piece of film . On July 22nd , 1979 , Hussein convened a meeting of Ba'ath Party officials . Hundreds sat in an auditorium while the brash cigar chomping president declared that he 'd uncovered a plot to overthrow his regime . One by one the names of the alleged traitors were called out , and one by one they were pulled from their seats . At least 22 were executed for a conspiracy that many believe was pure fiction , hatched by Hussein to demonstrate his absolute authority . While Hussein was quickly securing his strangle hold over Iraq , he was setting his sights beyond the border . In 1980 he attacked Iran to seize a waterway to the Persian Gulf . The war dragged on for years . Before a cease-fire was finally declared , the loss of life was staggering . Hundreds of thousands on both sides were killed , including wave after wave of unarmed men and young boys . Through it all and beyond , Hussein 's cult of personality was growing . At home , in schools across Iraq , his image was everywhere . His word , final . His legacy , he assumed , just beginning .
BC	Let` s start with the doom , and there` s lots of it : 61 percent of the people think that it is somewhat or very likely that the U.S. will be hit by a terrorist attack this year . And 64 percent of us think that terrorists will attack somewhere in the world with nuclear or biological weapons before 2008 . Ninety-three percent believe that gas prices will go up -- uh , you think so ? -- and 74 percent think global warming will get worse . OK , pretty gloomy , right ? But here` s one question that did n` t make the headlines . Researchers asked people what the likelihood of a cure for cancer being found this year . What` s the likelihood of that ? I do n` t know , 2 percent , 3 percent ? No. Good news , everybody . According to your fellow Americans , there is a 35 percent chance that a couple of pills will cure your brain cancer by this time next year . Unfortunately , not going to be able to really celebrate for very long , because the public also thinks the odds are 50-50 that the bird flu hits the U.S. this year . Easy come , easy go , I guess . And my favorite prediction of all from the polls is this one : one in four Americans , a full 25 percent , believe that it is somewhat or very likely that Jesus Christ himself will return to Earth this year , 25 percent . Now , this is just a guess -- it was n` t in the poll -- but I` m betting that close to 100 percent of those people watch this program . Next , believe it or not , a lot of really important things , aside from all those people that died , happened over the holiday while we were n` t paying attention . But the real story tonight is that some of those things happened specifically because we were n` t paying attention . So let me catch you up on the important ones . First , Iran surprisingly did n` t take any time off for Hanukkah . Made lots of news . It all started with the U.S. catching -- try this on for size -- the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops in Iraq , finding smoking-gun evidence that they`ve been involved in the attack on coalition troops and Iraqi citizens . Oh , it` s just a little act of war by a foreign country . Who cares ? It` s Christmas . More turkey ? Then , the U.N. Security Council , which has stalled on sanctions against Iran for months , waited until two days before Christmas to finally pass sanctions . President Tom responded by first writing a secret letter to the Pope , then by saying the U.S. is a nobody who will soon be humiliated by Iran . Oh , oh , and , then , President Tom` s adviser publicly declared that Hitler -- try this on for size -- Hitler was actually a Jew whose true intention was to establish a Jewish state . Wait . Do n` t laugh . Think about that for a second . Now you can laugh . Then , just a few days before Christmas , rape charges were finally dropped in the Duke lacrosse team case . The prosecutor probably waited until Christmas to announce it , because he hoped that people would n` t be paying any attention to it . Unfortunately for him , at least one group of people was paying attention : the North Carolina Bar . Now he` s facing ethics charges and possible disbarment . Good .
BC	Let me -- let me change gears on another story that has me confused . And that is Anna Nicole Smith . There was a -- there` s a web site that I saw -- and this is what -- I` m not -- I kind of lost the Anna Nicole Smith story when she was fat and then skinny and then doped up and then had a baby . I do n` t know what` s going on and who the people are in her life . But there was this web site that I saw that is actually showing a picture of the guy and , as a kid , and then the baby . And he` s saying , " Hey , looks like me as a kid . Anna Nicole Smith` s baby is mine . " And what is this story ? Because there` s now a paternity test that she has to go through ? Well , Larry Birkhead , a celebrity photographer who did have an romantic relationship with her ... Come on . Well , a sexual relationship with her . Thank you . We are talking Anna Nicole Smith , please . Claims that he` s the father . Wants to see his daughter . A judge has ordered DNA tests , which has to be done by January 23 . And Larry Birkhead` s lawyers says we`re going to make it easy for her . We`re just going to come to her door . All she has to do is answer the door in her bathrobe . Now , that sounds like it could be pretty hard for her , but nonetheless , supposed to be done by January 23 . And I guess we`ll find out who the DNA will say . She says that it` s not his . She said it` s somebody else , right ? She says it` s her lawyer/boyfriend Howard K. Stern . But those baby pictures on Larry Birkhead` s web site , LarryBirkhead .net , do suggest that there` s some similarity . Maybe a lot of babies look the same . I do n` t know . What would -- what would his motivation be to claim that it` s his child if it was n`t ? Is there money to be gained from her ? Or... You know , I do n` t think -- I think there` s money to be spent . Because if he is the father , he` s going to be paying child support . He` s going to be a father to the daughter . I think he wants to be this girl` s father . OK . Great . Lloyd , thank you very much . We`ll be back with " The Real Story " in just a second . All right , welcome to the " Real Story . " If you had n` t heard yet , Oprah Winfrey has just cut the ribbon on a brand-new $ 40 million school for girls in South Africa , and she funded the entire project herself . To put that in perspective , that is close to five whole months of her annual salary . Now , to get into the school , you`ve got to meet some very strict age and income criteria . But most importantly , you have to demonstrate both academic and leadership potential . But that did n` t stop people from applying . The tiny school has received over 3,500 applications ; 4 percent were accepted . To put that into perspective , Yale University accepts 13 percent .
BC	She can certainly be sued for malicious prosecution if the allegations are proven false . But my guess is she does n` t have a lot of money , given her background and so forth . Around a stripper pole . Steven , thanks a lot . Be back in a minute . All right , welcome to " The Real Story . " Now , on yesterday` s radio program , I asked listeners to call in with their predictions for 2007 . Most of them were , you know , ridiculous , things like , you know , that this TV show would beat the TV Guide Channel in ratings in 2007 . Hello ? It` s the TV Guide Channel . But there was one prediction that actually stood out . A guy named Michael called me up , and told me that his prediction was that Phoenix , Arizona , would be involved with something huge this year on the terrorism front . He said there have been too many stories involving that city lately for all of it to be coincidence . Well , if you know me at all , I am just conspiratorial enough to be interested in something like that . And lucky for me , probably unfortunately for you , I`ve also got a full TV staff of journalists to put to work on my whims and hunches . So I did . Here is " The Real Story " tonight . Michael , you`re right : An awful lot of isolated incidents going on involving Phoenix . And if you look at each of them individually , you kind of go , " Wow , that` s kind of interesting . " But you put them all together ? And , well , you decide . First , you remember that FBI memo -- it came out right before 9/11 , caused this huge uproar politically because supposedly that was the document that had the idea that Osama bin Laden was sending terrorists to flight schools in the U.S. And nobody did anything about it . Well , guess what ? You know what that memo was actually called ? The " Phoenix memo , " because it was written by the Phoenix FBI . It reads , in part , " Phoenix has observed an inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest who are attending civil aviation colleges in the state of Arizona . " Hmm , interesting , right ? Now , and when the 9/11 report finally was issued , it contained 59 references to terrorist activity in Arizona and mentioned , for the first time , the existence of a highly classified FBI-CIA report titled , " Arizona : Long Range Nexus for Islamic Extremists , " end quote . That report still has n` t been made public . We do n` t know what that says . Nothing to see here people . Move along . Shh . Now , fast forward . Remember in past -- what was it ? -- I think it was November . The guy who was stopped by Detroit police and was found to be carrying $ 80,000 in cash , he had information about cyanide on him , nuclear power plants , and suitcase bombs , along with newspapers commemorating the 9/11 attacks . Now , just in case you think all of that is a coincidence , he also had a handwritten note that said , quote , " This community is angry . Something is going to happen . We`re just going to see justice . This is a powder keg waiting to go off , " end quote . Oh , oh , I forgot one other thing that I failed to mention here . When he was arrested , he was arrested in the airport on his way to Phoenix .
BC	More courage from Rocky Balboa as he panders to his Mexican audience . Coming up next , House Democrats moving fast and tackling ethics right out of the gate . We 'll have a report on the new rules of the game in D.C. The Democrats off to a good start . The Reverend Jesse Jackson says it 's time for Congress to push for a change in urban policy . He 'll be here with us to discuss that . And the hunt for radical Islamist terrorists intensifying in east Africa . We 'll have a special report to you tonight from Nairobi . Stay with us . As they promised , congressional Democrats are taking aim at the cozy relationship between lawmakers and lobbyists . Public disgust with corruption on Capitol Hill prompting today 's tightening of ethics rules , but whether it 's enough to keep members from being bought and sold is still in question . Lisa Sylvester reports . Kentucky congressman Hal Rogers and his wife spent a week in Kona , Hawaii , last January . Airport executives picked up the $ 7,000 tab . They also paid for his visits to Dublin , Ireland , and San Francisco . Under newly-adopted House ethics rules that passed 430-1 , lobbying groups can no longer pay for such trips , meals and entertainment . When the speaker 's gavel comes down , it intends to open the people 's House , not the auction House . In the opening hours of the new congressional session , House Democrats have kept a pledge to clean up the swamp of corruption in Washington . House lawmakers are banned from flying on corporate jets at reduced prices . Congressional travel financed by outside groups must be approved in advance and immediately disclosed . November 's elections spurred the House to take quick action . Voters demanding change after a string of lobbying scandals . Today we sever the links between those who would buy influence on Capitol Hill and those who would willingly sell it . Public watchdog groups are now pressing Congress to create an independent enforcement office to hold lawmakers to the new standards . They also say pensions of convicted lawmakers should be taken away , but overall , they are praising the new rules . FRED WERTHEIMER , DEMOCRACY 21 : What the new rules do in the end is challenge the culture of entitlement on Capitol Hill , whereby members had become used to having their lifestyles paid for by lobbyists and other influence-seekers . Congress for so long has operated on a pay-to-play system , where those with the deepest pockets have the loudest voice . That could now be changing . The Senate is expected to take up a similar ethics package Monday . Now , the one House member who voted against the ethics rules was Representative Dan Burton because he claims it does not go far enough . However , Burton , like many other members of Congress , has gone on a few junkets , including a week-long visit to Taiwan with his wife last fall that cost $ 15,000 , paid for , Lou , by business interests -- Lou . A business interest . Well , $ 2 billion spent by lobbyists in Washington , D.C. , and I think just about everyone would agree that they have certainly made a good investment over the past decade . The idea that this could be ending is something to rejoice .
BC	That was three years ago . Today they 're celebrating Christmas in this small rental house after a terrible ordeal . A year after buying their home , the troubles started . We had a minivan , and he had a Grand Am , and the cars were just constantly breaking down . And we had to keep paying to have those fixed , which in turn made our credit card bills go up . And we decided to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy to get rid of the debt that was just weighing down on us . They thought ... It 's one thing to get a home equitiy loan to actually make improvements to your house , but many folks are using their houses as piggy banks , paying for expensive cars , luxury vacations , even second homes . Now that means less equity in the home , more debt , and much higher monthly payments . Here is CNN 's Thelma Gutierrez . Christmas season at the Basore home . It was supposed to be a time of joy . This is probably going to be our last Christmas here . Mark and Mary Basore had planned to raise their son in this Sunland , California , home . It represented their future . We did the new floors , new carpet . They bought the house four years ago . In that short amount of time , their home more than doubled in value . Things never looked better . You guys were sitting on a mountain of equity . I know . Right ? You had , what , $ 300,000 equity . We were sitting on a mountain of equity . And that 's where the dollar signs , you know , we could do it on our own . They wanted to start a business . So they did what a lot of people do , they took out a home equitiy loan . The Basore 's pulled out everything , $ 300,000 . Got free samples today . And they opened a Juice It Up franchise in Valencia , California . But the spending did n't stop there . We decided let 's just buy a little $ 5,000 boat . Taking friends out to dinner , you know on a Saturday night or something . Just because we have all the money in the bank . This is my 34-foot RV that I love . And they remodeled their house . But their new business was slow to start . And money was n't coming in . We refinanced and took the cash out . Came up short . Refinanced again to get some more money out and then after that money , we came up short , too . So they took out loans on their vehicles which had already been paid off and they racked up more credit card debt . What is the pressure like when you have all these mounting bills ? I just -- I just do n't want to look at them . They 're not going to go away . Now they 're dangerously close to foreclosure . Their only choice , to sell their home in a California market that 's cooling down . This is my ad on Craig 's List begging people to come look at my open house . You used the word begging . Begging . Literally . In capital letters , owners are desperate , must sell . Was it hard when you put up that for sale sign ?
BC	I know . So I 'd rather be around . I know . And that 's one of the reasons I love you is that you , after being in this business and doing all these interviews for 50 years , you 're still so vulnerable and you 're still -- you have an open mind , not so much the brain -- that your brains fall out , but you 're still very open-minded . And you have asked me on the street one day -- I 'll never forget it , in front of the Peninsula Hotel , you literally came over and you said , " Nay , why are you so darned happy ? What 's your secret ? " And I told you ? You forgot . No, you -- you believe . I believe , yes . I know . I believe . I -- I 'm a believer . Now ... Well , that 's ... ... that makes all the difference in the world . That helps you . Yes . Yes . And one time I interviewed you and I asked you what would be the first question you would ask god . Do you remember what you said ? Did you have a son ? Yes . I thought that was the greatest answer ever . Or a daughter . Of course you could show the world into chaos , depending on the answer . I mean ... That 's the next show . It could affect a lot of... OK . Getting back to that question , I think that you have to acknowledge that death is inevitable . I 've given -- I 've been there to help most -- I 've caught babies as a midwife . I 've also had the exquisite privilege of being with people when they made the passage . So I 've been at both ends of the spectrum . And I can tell you that you should start thinking about your passing just like you 're planning a wedding or getting ready for Christmas . You absolutely need to do that . All right ... Death is our last taboo . You tell me , why is it that -- we talk about stuff we should n't talk about ... Because it 's the unknown . But you can sort of start wrapping your mind around it and it really helps you live better . When we come back , all three of them are big stars . So how does that affect the way Naomi , Wynonna and Ashley Judd celebrated the holidays ? Naomi gives us some surprising holiday details . And we 'll talk about how the kids are doing , when we come back . Well , good night . The lord 's coming . Good night , the lord 's coming . Good night , the lord 's coming , knocking at the door , the door flew open and the love comes streaming down . Lord , down . Lord , down . We 're back with the acclaimed Naomi Judd , one of my favorite people , the Grammy Award-winning country music star , author of " Naomi 's Guide to Aging Gratefully : Facts , Myths and Good News for Boomers . " Can't go an hour without talking about the kids . How is Wynonna doing ? Miss Sprungoffs ( ph ) is so out and about right now . She 's very popular . She had a fabulous Christmas album . How is she doing with the weight ? The emotional -- she was telling us about it .
BC	We 're tracking both of these stories for you this morning . We 're going to have a live report from Baghdad straight up . Yes . Worth pointing out that 60 miles away from the airport , the standard operating procedure there is to stay very high until the last minute , then do a steep decline . Right . So they would have been at fairly high altitude . So it will be interesting to see how this one plays out . Kraft spending $ 245 million on a coffee machine . Sounds like the Pentagon must be involved in this one . Twenty-six minutes past the hour . Ali Velshi " Minding Your Business . " Coffee . On-demand coffee machines , these single-cup coffee machines , they 've been a big deal , they 've been growing over the last few years . About a $ 1.5 billion a year business . Kraft got involved with Braun in the Tassimo market . There are a lot of these different machines . The idea is Braun makes these machines , Kraft sells the coffee in these little pods . You have to make some commitment before you buy one of these machines , because once you buy them , you 're stuck buying the coffee of the coffee maker . It is n't working out so well for Kraft . The company is writing off $ 245 million , its commitment to this thing , and says it 's going to scale back on the production of this . So people are n't buying this . You know , I do n't know if people are buying -- are n't buying all of them . It 's expensive . Yes . It 's useful if you 're one person and you 're making coffee and no one else drinks coffee . You do n't want to waste a pot . But it 's -- you really have to be pretty committed to it . So that is the story with Kraft . We 'll see what happens . I want to track this coffee industry and see what goes on with it . All right . Another caffeinated report from Ali Velshi . That 's right . Thank you very much -- Soledad . Top stories of the morning coming up . A firefight in the streets of Baghdad . We 've been talking about it all morning , and we 'll bring you the very latest on that . Plus , we 'll talk to a couple who lost everything in Hurricane Katrina but could finally be getting something from their insurance company . AMERICAN MORNING , we 've got the most news in the morning right here on CNN. Developing story this morning . U.S. troops and attack helicopters are in a major battle with insurgents in Iraq . We 're live in the middle of it , straight ahead . A legal storm , a settlement apparently in the works by State Farm Insurance . Could thousands of Hurricane Katrina victims in Mississippi finally be getting some checks ? And controversial care . A closer look at one couple 's effort to keep their mentally-disabled daughter from growing into an adult . It 's still igniting debate on this AMERICAN MORNING. Good morning to you . Tuesday , January 9th . I 'm Miles O'Brien . And I 'm Soledad O'Brien . Thanks for being with us . Happening this morning -- President Bush is working on his plan to change strategy in Iraq . He 'll announce the plan on national TV tomorrow night . He 's meeting today with Republicans and Democrats , both sides of the aisle , voicing concern about sending more troops to Iraq .
BC	You know what ? Does that mean she` s not subject to the laws in this country ? Not saying that . But what kind of a bond risk is that , Nancy ? Yes . You`re right , a flight risk and a low bond , bad recipe . Quick break . When we come back , the clock` s ticking in the search for a 13-year-old straight-A student . Every hour that goes by , it` s getting a little bit harder . Everybody inside the family still has not given up . Everyone` s still got that big ray of hope hanging out there . It` s our worst nightmare , you know ? I do n` t even know how to explain how we feel . You know , it` s rough . It` s really rough . We just want Ben back . A 13-year-old little boy -- he` s only 4`1 0" , 100 pounds , straight-A student , a Boy Scout -- gets off the school bus , at the school stop , just yards from his parents` home , and disappears in rural Missouri . Tonight , the search is still on with the FBI and police for a white Nissan truck , saying Nissan across the back . It` s pretty dinged up , rusted , no hubcaps , got a camper on the back . Look at this . Can you help ? The tip line : 636-583-2560 . A press conference went down this afternoon . Take a listen . These cases in general are extremely difficult to solve nationwide , you know , and that` s usually because of lack of witnesses and lack of evidence . And that` s kind of what we`re facing here . We`ve got one witness , you know , that has given us a very good description of the truck . But we need the public` s help . He liked to play on the computer , play games on the computer , but there was no indication that he was really getting on the Internet or making contact with anybody on the Internet . So that does n` t look like it` s going to reveal anything to us . Now , I know it` s very frustrating for the family . We know what they`re going through . And , you know , we would really like to bring this thing to a close , obviously . And it wears on us , but it does n` t wear near as much on us as it does them . This is in Beaufort , Missouri . It` s a very rural area , about 60 miles from St . Louis . But does this indicate someone was stalking the child or following the school bus ? Was this a random act ? How could the assailant , the kidnapper , find this home , out on a gravel road in a rural area ? How did he know to go there ? Out to 550 KTRS Radio reporter , Melanie Streeper , Melanie , how has the evidence developed today ? Well , what I can tell you , Nancy -- and so far , about 30 leads have come in since Ben went missing Monday afternoon . So police continue to work those leads . They say that the investigation is progressing , and they have talked to some people of interest . Take a listen to this . Apparently we have about 20 officers assigned , and additionally today we also had our SWAT team that came out to assist in the grid search and the different searches that were being conducted .
BC	You have Senator John McCain , former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani , and former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney . They are widely considered the three leading contenders right now in the 2008 Republican sweepstakes . All of them support more troops . So , among the Republicans , those who are most likely , if you will , to inherent this war from the president of the United States , they support him right now . So -- but , among the Democrats , it will be fascinating . They oppose sending more troops . They can vote that way on a nonbinding resolution . It would be fascinating to see how they vote if it really matters . And , Bill Schneider , the president obviously believes in what he 's doing . But is what he is doing right for the country ? Does this nation need another epic battle right in the middle of a war that 's giving it so much trouble ? Well , I mean , this is a battle that the president does n't want . He does n't need it . You 're quite right about that . The problem with this policy is really two things . Number one , it 's a political war we 're fighting . Everyone seems to be saying the same thing : The only solution to this war is a political settlement . Well , Americans do n't like political wars . They think the military should fight military battles , battles they can win . And , second of all , it 's a proxy war , because , if you listened to the president 's speech very carefully , he said , the success of this new strategy depends on what the Iraqi government is capable of doing , not what our own military is capable of doing . And you know what ? Americans do n't have a lot of confidence in the Iraqi government . Yes , it 's certainly an open question . Bill Schneider , Dana Bash , John King , thanks , all . While debate continues on President Bush 's new plan for Iraq , two debates are already on tap for the 2008 presidential campaign . You will be able to see them right here on CNN. We are teaming up with television station WMUR and " The New Hampshire Union Leader " to bring you back-to-back debates , the Republican and Democratic candidates , in New Hampshire on the 4th and 5th of April this year , a very early start to the presidential campaign . So , be sure to mark your calendars . Coming up next : why the prosecutor who charged three Duke lacrosse players with rape now wants off the controversial case . Plus : Should an Air Force staff sergeant who took it all off for " Playboy " also be allowed to serve her country ? This is 360 . Another dramatic twist in the Duke rape case tonight : The embattled district attorney , Mike Nifong , who is facing ethics charges that could lead to his disbarment , wants off the case . This development comes after court records filed this week show that the accuser apparently changed her story again , and less than a month after Nifong dropped the rape charges against the lacrosse players . For insight on what this all means for the case , let 's talk with CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
BC	Our health providers , doctors and hospitals , they have a responsibility to provide more affordable coverage , more affordable services . And with the elimination of this hidden tax associated with the uninsured and underinsured , our medical providers will be better positioned to provide more affordable services . Our health plans in California , under the governor 's plan , will be required to guarantee access to affordable coverage in the individual market . And finally , employers have a responsibility . The overwhelming majority of employers in California do provide health coverage . The governor 's plan insures that all employers are contributing financially to the support of this program . So , it 's a proposal that recognizes that universal coverage for all , affordable health care , will benefit all Californians and just as everyone will benefit , everyone has a responsibility to contribute . Kim , can you address one of the -- maybe it looks like an Achilles heel for the plan , which is a fear that some companies that currently provide health care coverage for their employees , maybe they 're small , maybe they 're strapped , maybe it 's hard for them , they might decide not to because of this , let their employees go into the state-run plan and then the plan might get overwhelmed . So first , what is the likelihood of that and how do you deal with that ? The majority of California employers provide health benefits today . And for those employers really nothing should change under this proposal , other than coverage should become more affordable and more available for employers and their employees . At the same time , the governor believes it 's important that all employers contribute . And so there is a modest fee on employers who choose not to participate in the program , in terms of providing coverage to their employees . They 're asked to contribute a modest fee that will help finance coverage for the uninsured . And we 've endeavored to structure it in a way to ensure that we 're not creating incentives for employers to drop coverage and shift their employees into the pool . And we really want to make sure that we are leveling the playing field , if you will , between non-offering employers and offering employers . The governor does n't think it 's fair to ask employers or the government to be subsidizing those employers who are walking away from this issue . Kim , one sort of flash point on this whole plan is that it covers illegal immigrants as well . And , you know , there are some people , critics , who say , why are we putting up money to cover people who are here illegally , and then how do you make sure that they 're going to participate in the program the way everybody should ? You know , how do they enroll ? How do they get involved ? Can you explain that a little bit ? It 's a very important issue . Governor Schwarzenegger 's plan calls for all Californians to have this responsibility to obtain health insurance . Under the governor 's plan all children will be eligible for our state 's S-Chip program , which we call Healthy Families , regardless of immigration status . That has been a long standing commitment of the governor and he really believes that all the children should have access to affordable coverage .
BC	It was Cherrie who put a face on missing children nationwide . The first child ever on a " Have you Seen Me ? " mailer delivered to homes around the country . That was her dog and that was her cat . This year , Cherrie would be 31 . And this is what investigators think she might look like . After 13 years of searching , Cherrie 's family asked the state to officially declare her dead . But at the family cemetery plot , there is an angel , not a grave stone . We live in a society where we need to see something . Until I see something or hold something or know something , I ca n't put it to rest yet . Janice McKinney calls what happened in Missouri a miracle . Twenty-two years later , she 's still waiting for hers . Randi Kaye , CNN, Mars , Pennsylvania . It is hard to imagine what that wait is like . Janice McKinney 's story , sadly is n't unique . Patty Wetterling 's son , Jacob , was kidnapped 17 years ago when he was just 11 . He would be 28 today . His mother , Patty , has turned her grief into activism , and she joins me now . Patty , thanks for being with us . I 'm sorry it 's under these circumstances . Tell us about your son , Jacob . He was abducted in 1989 . What happened ? PATTY WETTERLING , SON MISSING SINCE 1989 : He was biking home from a convenience store with his brother and his best friend , when a man with a gun confronted them about a half a mile from our house . The man let two of the boys go and kept Jacob and they ran home and said , call 911 , somebody took Jacob . And it 's been the largest manhunt Minnesota has ever known . It still continues . And there have no doubt been ups and downs over these years . What -- how do you get through it ? You get through it on hope and the belief that if we , as a nation , held hands and combed this nation , we would find more missing children . And I believe that fewer would be taken because of the awareness . This is a great moment to look at the problem of missing children and let 's all address it . It does seem like , you know , you hear the details , and we 're just starting to get the details from Shaw n 's case . But you know , there were neighbors who must have seen that Shawn was n't going to school . I mean , an 11-year-old boy for all these years not enrolled in school . There were people who must have -- you know , there was one mother who even said , oh , you kind of look like that missing child , Shawn . And he sort of laughed it off . Are there things that -- do people need to sort of open their eyes to the reality of what can happen ? I do believe that . We -- most missing children come home because an everyday citizen is aware of a situation that does n't look quite right . Trust your gut instincts . Look at the pictures of missing children and then call the police .
BC	Mark Miller has been covering the story for " Newsweek" . He joins me now . Mark , in this article that I read from " Newsweek" , you say that he uses the language of a wife abuser , or a spouse abuser . What does that mean exactly ? MARK MILLER , " NEWSWEEK" : Right . It means that he blames all of his troubles on Nicole . She` s changed . She` s not a good person anymore . She` s a bad mother . She` s flinging her sexual dalliances in his face . She` s -- she` s doing things that he disapproves of and pushing all his buttons , and he just ca n` t take it anymore . And he` s going to , you know , have to teach her a lesson . All right . What else is in this -- this chapter ? When you read it , what did your gut say ? Well , you know , like everyone I think I wondered what did it actually say , and when I got it , you know , I read it . And I have to say that , you know , if he wrote it or the ghostwriter wrote it , it` s a fairly convincing job , because it` s written as a first person narrative , very straightforwardly . But it` s really that tone , that tone of , you know , Nicole , she was , as he calls her , the enemy at one point . And he just -- he ca n` t take it anymore . He` s going to go over to Bundy` s , and he` s driving over there with a friend , which is a man he calls Charlie , which really is the major departure from the evidence in the case . And he` s putting on the cap and the gloves , which he keeps in the Bronco to have when it gets cold on the golf course . And he also has a knife which he actually calls a very nice knife , which he has to have because there are crazy people in L.A. , and you never know when you need a knife . So it` s the tone and then it` s those details that make it seem quite convincing , even though he still says it` s not true , and he has nothing to confess to . Well , I will tell you , I mean , I ca n` t believe I` m playing devil` s advocate and that is really what I` m playing here . You should . Let me play devil` s advocate . I` m just -- I` m reading a Vince Flynn novel right now . That seems pretty real . Right . And I agree . The facts as he lays them out were things that were fairly well known . Again , I think what really sends it over the top is the tone of the writing , because you can see O.J. and hear him as he works himself up into greater levels of rage . And it` s when , you know , he encounters Ron Goldman . He` s convinced , you know , that he` s going to have a sexual liaison with Nicole , and that` s why Ron Goldman is there , even though Ron keeps denying it . He just wants to return some glasses . And you know , one of the more chilling moments is when the dog , Kato , bizarrely named Kato , comes out of the condo . The dog , in O.J.` s view , is overly friendly to Ron and he wags his tail at him , and that kind of seals it for Ron , because O.J. thinks he` s been here before .
BC	Wait , wait , wait . Let me -- let me show this guy who I describe as the Amish guy from last night . Watch this . ... can be mean to me , mean as you want to be . Just say anything that you like . You can be nasty and catty and cruel and unusual . Twist my nose with your fingers , trip me as I carry liquid . OK . Stop . Stop . That guy really thinks he` s going to be on " American Idol " ? Yes That` s a plant . And he had -- and he sang something about spitting in his mouth , which was , like , totally unnecessary . It was horrible . Change the lyrics . Come on . But wait . But wait . Do you really think that that` s just somebody at home going , " I could get on the" -- you know , it` s somebody looking for their 15 minutes of fame . Yes . I think that some people do show up there just to be on camera and go over the top to do it . But I mean , you really have to be crazy enough to go on there and do that . You know ? Yes . They`ve already gone through the producers and the executive producer to get to the judges . OK . Now Diana Ross announced yesterday on David Letterman that she` s going to be ... Well ... I mean , she` s a little nuts , though , do n` t you think ? She` s going to be a mentor . But I do n` t know . It` s Diana Ross . Who cares ? She` s amazing . She` s nuts . I mean , you know ? I do n` t know her personally , so I` m not going to -- I` m not going to speak . Thanks , Glenn . I made you uncomfortable from start to finish , have n` t I ? You could n` t make me uncomfortable if you tried . Really ? No. Come next week . I`ll try a little harder . But I actually , you know , I think that that` s really cool that Diana Ross is going to be a mentor . I think it` s going to be really intimidating for the idols , but it will also prepare them to go in front of , you know , their other celebrity guests or judges that they`re going to have . All right . Kim , thanks . Up next , " The Real Story " on both Barack Obama and the falling oil prices . Have you noticed that ? Coming up next . Welcome to " The Real Story . " Have you ever noticed how the people who are vilified when things go wrong usually are not celebrated when those same things go right ? For example , do you have any idea what the name of the CIA director is right now ? Yes , I ca n` t really remember , either . You know why ? Because there has n` t been a terrorist attack in about five years . But trust me , if it happens , oh , you`ll know his name very , very well , because he` s going to be torn apart by every politician and columnist looking for a scapegoat . Now , I make that point because it` s exactly what` s happening right now with President Bush and oil prices . Last summer , oh , in the heat of the election , gas was $ 3 a gallon , and everybody was saying , " George Bush is in bed with the oil companies , giving special favors to his Texas oil buddies , " and then there was that big uproar over the huge profits that the oil companies were making . How can they live with themselves , making so much money over our backs when we ca n` t even afford gas for our cars ?
BC	Not at all . Nothing . You know , Hinduism is actually a very flexible religion . Nothing is an obligation . It is one 's own desire and fulfillment that one chooses to do . There are many who may not do any of the pilgrimages , who just continue to offer their worship at home , and there are some people who would like to do lots of pilgrimages , including Kumbh Mela . So there is nothing that compels that every Hindu must either visit Kumbh Mela or take a dip in any of these rivers . And , yes , Hajj is also pilgrimage , but perhaps that is a little bit more on a different sector . But among Hindus , it is something that one can choose to do or not to do . Do you hope to do it some day ? Yes , indeed . I do hope to do it , yes . Do you know anyone who has done it ? Have they said much about it ? I know a lot of people who have done it , and they just feel so elated . They 're full of praise for it . And they feel they come out as somebody new totally . And the thing I tell you , in Hinduism , since the religion is so flexible and we deeply believe in our strong religious faith , just like democracy , if you go into these Kumbh Melas , it is nothing but -- it is exhibited spiritual democracy in the country , because you will see people of all walks of life , irrespective of cast , creed , languages or anything that they believe in , and they 're all there assembling just for one cause . It does n't matter who they are , they listen to lectures , they listen to music they enjoy , and they can take a dip or they may just wash their feet in the River Ganges , but ultimately they feel they have achieved something which no amount of money or no amount of holiday vacations can bring them , and I think that 's what makes the spiritual fulfillment , yes . Uma Mysorekar , of the Hindu Temple Society of North America , thank you so much for talking with us . Thank you . We take another break . When we come back , there are a lot of other pilgrims who take different paths . A chance to talk about that . Stay with us . An unusual pilgrimage to the local cemetery . To mark the Day of the Dead , some Bolivians in Le Paz use an unlikely object of veneration , the human skull , an ancient tradition for the people of the Andes . They believe humans have seven souls and one remains in the skull . Welcome back . The Bolivian tradition is unusual and yet entirely ordinary at the same time because millions of people make their own journeys to their own sacred places . The locations differ and so do the trips themselves , but is the purpose the same ? Phil Cousineau is author of " The Art of Pilgrimage : The Seekers ' Guide to Making Travel Sacred , " and he joins us now . Thanks so much for being with us . How many different pilgrimages are there ? How many different religions revere pilgrimage ?
BC	If the media as Dan suggests , or the military rather as Dan suggests is very afraid of Thaksin Shinawatra , and yet it said it hopes to bring democracy back to Thailand before the end of this year , what role do you see the media playing in Thailand ? How do you think - see it shaping out , squaring off between the military and the media ? Well , you ca n't really have democracy without the media . And the media 's job is to be a check on the democratic process or on the military rulers in this case . So it 's an interesting struggle . And they 're going to have to - the media - I mean , if there is going to be return to democracy , the media 's going to have to be free . And the military leadership is going to have to wake up to that fact , otherwise as is possibly sadly all too predictable , democracy will be delayed . And the country 's economic problems are continuing , even without Thaksin . The bogeyman is gone , but the problems are still there . He may or may not have been corrupt , but who are the military to talk about corruption ? They 've been logging illegally for decades and running their own economic zones . I mean , there 's a lot of corruption in the system and plenty of people to point the finger at . Final question to you , Dan in Bangkok , have you noticed any difference at all in your ability to do your job in the four months since Thaksin Shinawatra was deposed from the political throne ? So far , no . I 'd say , you know , we 're still allowed to pretty much move around where we are . We 're still able to get visas to come and go from Thailand as we 'd like to . You know , there have been since this interview a few incidents in our bureau , for example , of sort of slightly menacing phone calls of people ringing and hanging up . Now that may be nothing to do with this at all , but it 's obviously a bit of a coincidence . And I think the big worry for media organizations like us , and you know , the other ones here , the BBC , and other big American networks is that this might be the beginning , you know , of a slippery slope , that suddenly the army will use , you know , the fact that we have carried an interview with Thaksin as an excuse for example not to renew visas , or to make life difficult for us . And I think that 's a big concern as we go into 2007 , you know , about really what is happening in Thailands , and you know , is there really going to be a restoration of democracy ? All right , something we 'll be following closely . Thank you , very much , Dan Rivers in Bangkok . And here in the studio , Leonard Doyle . Up next on INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTS , the bullying of a Bollywood star . Accusations of racism fly , as a reality TV show triggers uproar in India and Britain . Stay with us . Welcome back . A notorious reality TV show is sparking controversy from Britain to India . It centers on the alleged racist bullying over Bollywood star . Politicians have spoken out . Companies have withdrawn sponsorship and protested , have burned the producers in effigy .
BC	The personal lives of the characters are drawn into the show as well . Yes , yes . On the balance , on the scale , it 's more ... I know . But do you think that adds to the appeal ? That we learn more about them ? Well , particularly , I think , Kiefer 's character because he is a human being in this incredibly difficult work that he does . To me that 's what balances the show how out . We have the fear of terrorism and all of that . But we also watch a man , a real man , have to grapple with being that kind of person . And so to me , it 's a one - two punch . It really gives the show depth . So you 've got that draw , you 've got that " Give me more " adrenaline . And you 've got this pathos of this character . Ricky , is it tough to come into a successful show ? You did it twice . That 's correct . They made me feel so welcome here when I first showed up . I really felt like I was included . It was just a smooth transition for me . With " NYPD" there was more -- I think people expected more failure out of me . But when I jumped into that to replace a loved character like Jimmy Smits . Where this I was n't replacing anybody , I was just coming in ... A new character . A new character . You told me something , Kiefer , during the break . The show is a bigger hit out of the United States ? Yes . I mean , it 's -- and not to diminish its success here in the U.S. , but the thing that has always amazed me from the beginning was from Japan , Korea , Australia , South Africa , Central -- South America , Europe , all around the world this show had transcended language barriers , which is a very difficult thing to do . You 're talking about why you think that it might click with an audience . And it goes back to its origin . And its origin is that of a thriller . And there are some very key components to a thriller , but the number one component is you have to , A) care about the characters that are involved and that there is a threat to those characters . And the writers have managed to utilize those two components with this time component , the real time component , which I really do believe has put the genre on its ear , so to speak . And I think all of those things combined , with the intimacy of the characters as they have developed over the six years , has led to not only the show crossing those language and cultural barriers -- because there is a sense , a feeling that I have heard from people as they describe what they like about the show because obviously , it 's of interest to us . We would love to know why an audience is clicking with it because that 's what we want to be able to give them . And that 's the one thing that I have heard more than anything , is that it makes them sit on the edge of their seat . And that has to be a number of things conspiring with itself and with each other to make that happen . And I think the writers have really figured out how to learn from each season to progress forward . And I think we have , hopefully , as well .
BC	Now Hugo Chavez , for his part , tends to be rather direct , does n't he ? ROMAN Yes , he is . Thank you , Christine . Time now for some of your thoughts . Dick in Idaho said , " Lou , why would anyone be surprised that Congressman Duncan Hunter beat Senator John McCain in Arizona ? Arizona is crying out for help with their illegal alien problem . And what has McCain done for them ? He is pushing for a guest worker program and amnesty while the people of Arizona are paying millions to support the illegal aliens . " Michael in Pennsylvania , " Lou , did you really expect this president to pardon the Border Patrol agents when he called the Minutemen 'vigilantes ' in front of President Vicente Fox ? " Send us your thoughts to loudobbs.com . We 'll have more of your thoughts coming up here later . Each of you whose e-mail is read here receive a copy of my book " War on the Middle Class . " Next , imprisoned Border Patrol agents Compean and Ramos . T.J. Bonner , the president of the National Border Patrol Council , joins me . And three more candidates have entered the race for the White House . And the field , well , some think it 's already crowded . We think it 's going to get a lot bigger . We 'll have that report . The president will report on the state of our union tomorrow , and there may be some changes in policy coming . We 'll have that story . And a freighter runs aground off southwest England . Some of the ship 's cargo is washed ashore , and residents have been helping themselves . And guess what ? Because of events like this , science is actually learning something . We 'll share that with you next . Stay with us . The race for the White House has become even more crowded . Three more contenders announcing their interests over the weekend . The latest polls may suggest why this field is expanding so rapidly . Bill Schneider has our report . This presidential race is beginning it look like " American Idol . " Two more Democrats just got in . A governor who can claim international experience . I served this congressman , ambassador to the United Nations and as secretary of energy . And a senator who can claim white house experience . If you work hard and play by the rules , you can build a good life for yourself and your family . She 's got the best political adviser money ca n't buy . If you work hard and play by the rules you get rewarded . Hillary Clinton dominates the Democratic field according to this CNN Opinion Research poll . She 's followed by Barack Obama at 18 percent and John Edwards at 15 . After , that the last two Democratic nominees , neither of whom has declared an intention to run . Obama 's the new guy on that list . I 've been struck by how hungry we all are for a different kind of politics . Clinton does especially well with Democratic women . Forty-two percent from women . Twenty-seven from men . Obama is African American . But Clinton leads him by nearly 2-1 among minority Democrats . In the Republican race , two front-runners , Rudy Giuliani with 32 percent . John mccain with 26 . No one else in double digits . Older Republicans prefer McCain , the Vietnam War hero . Younger Republicans prefer Giuliani . The hero of 9/11 .
BC	There 's Miles . Miles gets a mustache . So , you know ... Oh my god . And just to be fair ... I 'm sure I would be on some kind of watch list with a look like that . Just to be fair , there 's me , which , I have to say , Soledad and I... We look a lot alike . We kind of look the same as we get older through the years . So it 's kind of scary . But it 's kind of funny . You can add in text , have it say something , send the e-mail on to your friends . Obviously it 's all just for fun , but the idea ... Another way to waste time at work . Exactly . But also , Career Builder really wants to get traffic to their site . So that 's one of their ways . You 've got to fill the 50 years up with something , and this is one of the things you should be doing . OK . No matter what , I 'm still not going to have a mustache . I 'm going to try to do something about the age spots . I 'll see if I can -- you know ... They have stuff for that . A good dermatologist can fix that . Please . Exactly . Well , no one ever looks that way in Hollywood . Oscars ' gold rush is on this morning . We 're moments away from the announcement of the nominations for this year 's Academy Awards . Stick around . We 're taking you live to Hollywood , next . You 're watching AMERICAN MORNING. The most news in the morning for the next 50 years , right here on CNN. The race for the White House is on . Hillary Rodham Clinton saying she 's ready to take her plan to the people . You 'll hear it . And the race is on for Oscar gold , too . We 're minutes away from the nominations from the Academy Awards . Those stories and much more ahead on this AMERICAN MORNING. Welcome back , everybody . It 's Tuesday , January 23rd . I 'm Soledad O'Brien . And I 'm Miles O'Brien . We 're glad you 're with us . President Bush is fighting an uphill battle , sending more troops into harm 's way from a nation weary of war . In the past he could count on support from military families , but now some of those troops are going on their second , third , and sometimes fourth deployments to the war zone . Our chief national correspondent John King is near Camp Lejeune , North Carolina with word on the weary troops . Good morning , John . Good morning to you , Miles . They 'll certainly be watching the president closely tonight , and you 're right , there is more skepticism , even more opposition here . We 're just up the road a bit from Camp Lejeune . The Army 's Fort Bragg is a few hours away . The Air Force Base , the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base , another of the many military installations here in North Carolina . There 's a reason they 'll be listening closely to the president -- when the nation goes to war in North Carolina it 's often more personal . Live fire drills at Camp Lejeune , anxious faces so young . Check every single quarter . The lesson here , door-to-door urban combat , preparation for battling insurgents in Iraq .
BC	The President of the United States . Instead of the usual Tuesday night basketball , the monitors at Kid Shelleen 's restaurant and sports bar were tuned not to games , but to the deadly serious business of a president trying to seek common ground with a newly Democratic Congress , a Congress aggressively challenging the new addition of troops to the Iraq war . Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq and I ask you to give it a chance to work . With all the turmoil over Iraq policy , the reaction , at least at this place , was surprisingly sympathetic , even among those who would not normally be the president 's supporters . I 'm encouraged with the positivity of the president . I am kind of a give peace a chance generation . And , you know , I 'm -- like I say , I evolved in the give peace a chance . But you know what ? I think we should probably give success in Iraq a chance . This was a diverse group . And those watching had diverse agendas . I was wildly disappointed that the rebuilding of New Orleans was not mentioned at all . There 's this supposed ongoing commitment to it , and yet it gets no attention . He talked about how important the economic development is in Iraq , and there 's no urban policy , and specifically there 's no policy for New Orleans . The state of our union is strong . Our cause in the world is right . And tonight , that cause goes on . God bless . He seemed kind of humble tonight , not as forceful in the way that he made his ideas and his viewpoints across . And I think -- I think he 's finally getting the message that the two parties need to work together in order to get anything solved . Political analysis , that 's every bit as valid as that for which we pay a lot of money to consultants . It 's the analysis from Kid Shelleen 's here in Wilmington -- Miles . Bob , the president will go to DuPont . DuPont is one of the leading corporate players in America , pushing for mandatory caps on carbon emissions to fight global warming . The president did n't go that far . It will be interesting to see how that plays out today . Well , the president is trying to highlight the fact that there 's some energy innovation that 's going on here at special labs . He 'll be talking about that at his speech right behind me at the DuPont Theater . But you 're right . The corporate executives seem to be getting on the greenhouse -- the whole bandwagon about global warming , and they 're trying to drag the President with them . Bob Franken in Wilmington . Thanks very much -- Soledad . All right , Miles . Thanks . You heard the reaction from Wilmington this morning . Let 's hear what people around the country think today . They 're already having their say and listening in to talk radio . We 're expecting a very lively discussion with two radio hosts who join us this morning . Steve Malzberg is in New York . He 's sitting in on Bill Bennett 's " Morning in America " show . Rachel Maddow of Air America is in our studio .
BC	Well we focus so much about drinking and driving , tell them to slow down , all those things . And you forget , you know , you 're doing that -- you are giving them that advice , and you 're talking on the phone while you 're driving . What 's the message ? Right . And everybody is working on their Blackberry when they 're not supposed to be . And everybody is eating and -- Blackberrying and driving -- do n't do that . They do . That 's the message you send . We knew 2006 was a bad year for Ford . But how bad was it ? About 24 minutes past the hour , Carrie Lee , " Minding Your Business " . Historically bad , I guess you could say . Historically bad , would be an understatement , Miles . The numbers just in a few moments ago . Ford posting its worst annual loss in its 103-year history ; $ 12.7 billion in losses in 2006 . Nearly half of that , $ 5.8 billion , lost in the fourth quarter alone . Bottom line , we know this story , high gas prices have put a crimp in sales , there is less demands for Fords bread & butter trucks and SUVs . Japanese rivals continue to gain ground with their more fuel efficient cars . Also , looking ahead , analysts say that 2007 is not going to be a great year for Detroit either . In the case of Ford they 're not expecting a big rebound . General Motors will report on Tuesday . We will hear from Daimler-Chrysler mid-February . One caveat , going forward , President Bush 's plan to raise fuel economy standards , if that happens it could force Detroit to come up to speed , compared to other makers , like Toyota and Honda . But , of course , Miles and Soledad , Detroit would have to spend money to get there and raise their standards . But that is the latest from Ford . We 'll certainly be watching that stock today . All right . Carrie Lee , thank you very much . Top stories of the morning are coming up next . The war in Iraq , and the war on Capitol Hill . A Senate push to stop the build up of troops . How far will it go ? And a break in a cold case , a cold-blooded murder . What could be justice at last for a determined family , 43 years after some murders in Mississippi ? A live report is ahead . You are watching AMERICAN MORNING , the most news in morning , right here . War of words : A Senate resolution says no to sending more troops to Iraq ; the vice president firing back , only on CNN.

I 'm Soledad O'Brien . I 'm Miles O'Brien . We 're glad you are with us . Happening this morning : Details emerging of a foiled plot to smuggle refined uranium , the kind used in nuclear bombs . A Russian man caught trying to sell it , carrying it in a plastic bag in his pocket . He is in jail now in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia . He claimed to have enough uranium to make a small bomb .
BC	Yes , I can see why that might be a problem . Yes , pretty sticky . All right , Carrie Lee , thank you very much . Top stories of the morning coming up next , including potentially controversial change in strategy in Iraq . We 'll take you live to the White House to tell you about it . Plus , a suspect is finally in custody accused of murder in Mississippi . We 're going to talk , this morning , to the brother of a victim and the filmmaker who may have helped to crack the case .

Now the competition is struggling to keep up . We 've got those stories straight ahead on this AMERICAN MORNING. Welcome , everybody . It 's Friday , January 26th . I 'm Soledad O'Brien . I 'm Rick Sanchez . Sitting in for Miles O'Brien . By the way , I like the new digs . Thank you , like our new set , huh ? I do . It 's colorful . Cool . It 's great . Easy to work . Thumbs up . Good , we 'll have you back . All right . Let 's begin with what 's happening this morning . Got a developing story out of Pakistan for you . There 's a bomb blast outside the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad . A lot of foreigners stay at this hotel . It 's very near to the prime minister 's house . Now , apparently a suicide bomber killed himself , two guards , also . The bomber was stopped while trying to enter the hotel through the laundry , to set off his explosives , when he was stopped by those guards . In Baghdad a pet market filled with families is the latest insurgent target this morning . At least 15 people are dead after the bombing , dozens of other people have been hurt . Police think the bomber may have hidden explosives inside a cardboard box that had holes punched in it , so he could pass it off as a container to hold birds . Right now , in Brussels , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is meeting with official from NATO , pledging more money for Afghanistan . And the top man at the United Nations atomic energy agency says the diplomacy is the only option when it comes to dealing with Iran . Mohammed ElBaradei telling the World Economic Forum that any military attack on Iran would be catastrophic , and it would only push Tehran to develop nuclear weapons . These days you ca n't talk about Iran without talking about Iraq . And in Iraq there 's a controversial new tactic , shoot to kill Iranian operatives . That 's right . This morning 's " Washington Post " is saying that the Bush administration is giving U.S. troops the ok to kill Iranian nationals working for the insurgency . Obviously , it 's an escalation from the previous policy , which allowed troops to catch and release suspected Iranian agents after they were documented . Soledad ? President Bush is holding a strategy session with his top military advisors in just a few hours , including the new Defense Secretary Robert Gates . Now the meeting comes as senators on both sides of the aisle work on resolutions opposing the president 's plan to send more troops into Iraq . CNN 's congressional correspondent Dana Bash is live for us from Capitol Hill this morning with more on these competing resolutions . Dana , good morning .
BC	All night long . Um , oh , what a feeling when we 're dancing on the ceiling . Wait . Is that the wrong Lionel Richie song ? And life is like a song . And we 'll share tomorrow together . May I touch your hand ? Well , I left a good job in the city , working for the man every night and day . These final hours , I will lay down my heart ... OK . That was very good . Yes . We 're back . Justin Guarini , Kimberly Caldwell , Ace Young and Bucky Covington remain . Joining us from New York now is Sarah Goldberg . She auditioned for this season 's " American Idol , " was not sent to Hollywood . Sarah , I understand you went to the auditions to support a friend who was a serious singer and you decided to audition on a whim , on a whim , right ? What happened to your friend ? SARAH GOLDBERG , AUDITIONED FOR THIS SEASON 'S " AMERICAN IDOL , " REJECTE She did n't make it . And ... And neither did you . Well , no , but I made it a little while , you know ? I... You sure did . All right , let 's take a look at your appearance on the " American Idol " audition show . This is Sarah Goldberg . Til tomorrow , I 'll be holding you tight and there 's nowhere in the world I 'd rather be . I think you do n't have to sing to be an American Idol . I really do n't . This is a singing competition . It 's not a competition of like trying to find the best person that ca n't sing but really wants to . But I could be the only American Idol who has never sang before . Hey , I ca n't sing either . Look at this ! I 'm unique ! Whoooo! Just because we do n't have a million dollars and we do n't have singing deals does n't mean that we do n't have lives and it does n't mean that we do n't have important things in our lives . Sarah , Goldberg , do you still feel the same way ? Hey , yes . You know , they were really rude to us , that I actually -- if you count the time that I spent at the big arena in East Rutherford , New Jersey and then coming back for two rounds of auditions , I was actually there for 35 hours for those five minutes on -- on camera . And , you know , that 's ridiculous . Do you think you were treated poorly ? Yes . You know , I do n't think that they were nice to me . But I mean I 'm -- I 'm not a singer . Like this was just for fun . Well , why would an admitted non-singer want to go into a competition for singers , which is the number one rated show in the country ? What would you add to that if you ca n't sing ? Well , you know , I just tried out because I came to support a friend and I figured I 'm up at 4:30 in the morning , I might as well try out . And they put me through because they thought I was funny . And , you know , I have to tell you , I got suckered in . That it 's pretty intense when you 're in this room . You have a lot of stress on you and , you know , I kind of bought into the whole mentality , which is kind of ridiculous because I 'm not a singer .
BC	I would say between -- no more than three pounds . So it` s fairly light . It was light . And it` s held on by ... That was moved by a 3-year-old ? But no screws , because it had been hit in an accident . But , Sheriff , could a 3-year-old find it , open it , get in ? I mean , is there a foothold in there once he got in ? How could he put the lid back on ? I think it` s extremely highly unlikely that he could put the lid back on , and that` s why we`re investigating all of the possibilities , and we`re going to run tests . We did take the riser and the lid , and we placed it into evidence to process it . And I think it` s highly , highly unlikely . Sheriff , was there a custody battle going on between the dad and mom ? I understand that there is , yes . Back out to you , Wendy Ostrom-Price , she` s joining us , KOFI Radio News director . We were told by the paternal grandfather that the dad in this case had passed a polygraph . Any info on that ? WENDY OSTROM-PRICE , NEWS DIRECTOR , KOFI RADI No, the FBI is not releasing their results of the polygraph test . Now , what else can you tell us about the search for the boy , Wendy ? What was the dad doing during the search ? OSTROM-PRIC The dad , I think , was searching , rounding up people he knew . They were printing posters immediately , because , you know , from the get-go , they did n` t know if the child had wandered off or was abducted . Wendy Ostrom-Price is with us . She broke the story to start with regarding this little boy . Was it snowing that night , Wendy ? OSTROM-PRIC It was not snowing , but it was very foggy and very cold . Now , the dad says he left the boy by the van for how long ? OSTROM-PRIC I`ve heard anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes . OK , 30 seconds does n` t make sense , to leave it -- what` s the story , Wendy ? Why would he take the boy out to the van and leave him standing there and say , " Get in , " and then go back inside ? I mean , what` s the purpose of walking him out ? OSTROM-PRIC I ca n` t speak for him , of course , but he said that this was a smart boy . He said he was not a boy that tended to wander off and that this was something that they did . Wendy , what was the dad doing in the 20 minutes it took him to call 911 ? OSTROM-PRIC He told the authorities that he was searching around the house . And he also called the boy` s mother , and some family members searched before calling . OK . Wait a minute , where was the mom ? OSTROM-PRIC The mother told me that she was getting ready to go play some pool when she got the call from him and that they came over and they all started looking . How far away was the mom when the dad called ? Where` s that ... OSTROM-PRIC I` m not sure how far away she was . I think he reached her on his cell phone .
BC	But they 're not going to do this near a rich white neighborhood . That 's -- well , part of it is , if you need 100 acres for a landfill , are you going to go to rich part of town , where it 's expensive , and you also have people who maybe know network anchormen and know to write letters to the editor , and make a lot of noise , or you go somewhere where the land is , A , cheaper to buy , and , B , the neighborhood -- neighborhood there may not be as sophisticated , may not have the access to the media , may not have the activist orientation to make a lot of noise ? Now , that may be ... So , you 're saying this is about economics and not race ? Well , that may be class . That may be unjust . I do n't think it 's necessarily racism . And I would be very cautious about throwing that grenade , unless we can demonstrate that , yes , in fact , it 's racism , and not just injustice or taking advantage of people because of their poverty . Is it irresponsible to even suggest that this is racism ? You heard what the local government had to say in its defense . Irresponsible ? It 's nothing less than racism . I mean , let 's be honest here . Race and class go hand in hand in instances like this . When the majority of your lower-economic class is predominantly people of color , hello ? That means race and class are hand in hand . If -- if you put landfills and chemical waste dumps near people who are our weakest , most ill-informed , ignorant people , we 're supposed to be a nation that protects its citizens . Hang on . Under God ... No, no , no -- with liberty and justice for all . If those citizens are not informed , would it not be our job to inform them ? Those people were not informed . That 's unfair to the core . That 's against the principles of this nation . The word racism is highly inflammatory . The word racism goes to intention . No, no . Racism needs no racist intent . If the issue is to harm blacks , then , yes , it 's racist . If the issue is , we want to go somewhere where we can buy land cheaply , where people are n't going to complain , I do n't think that 's racism . It may unjust . It needs no racist intent . Racist effect is enough . It may be awful . It may be a terrible thing to do . But I do n't think it 's a racist thing . We need to be able to prove that before you throw that word around . Wait a minute . Michael . We 're not talking about natural waste . We 're not talking about garbage . We 're talking about ... But let 's talk about intent here . Right . OK . Are you going to tell me tonight ... Yes . Yes . Yes . ... that this government decided , we 're going to tell all the white people ... Yes . ... that they should n't drink this water , but ... No, of course not . ... we 're not going to give the black family enough warning , so they drink it and bunch of them get sick ? It is n't that obvious , Paula .
BC	But very quickly , Tom - you know , we`re seeing these pictures now . But you can bet somebody` s going to slip into that theater with a camera phone . He is nude in the play . This could get worse . O`NEI This could get really worse . That` s the biggest danger here is . They`re not going to be able to block out all of the camera phones .

BC	Rusty , thanks . Good to -- nice reporting , as always . My next guest has the tough job of getting this community through this . And particularly , this community 's children . Anna Cowin is the superintendent of schools here in Lake County . It 's a school system tonight that is dealing with a loss . One of your students has passed away . A young girl , 17 years old . How -- first of all , really , you 've set up this , an early warning system that enabled you to get information to the kids , to their parents that the schools were closed down , not to even try to go to school today . Well , very early this morning , at 6:00 o'clock , we started the alert system and were able to put it in effect in minutes and make calls out to literally thousands of people . It 's a great system that you really started because of another incident in the past . When you 've experienced a loss of at least one student that we know of , a young girl -- I talked to her mother earlier . Her name is Brittney May ( ph ) . She wanted to be a Marine . She wanted to go into ROTC . How do you help the other kids deal with that ? Well , we have grief counselors at the schools . And in fact , we had some other students that , according to some reports that I 'm getting , that have passed away . And during the school day , we sent counselors to the schools because students were coming in on bus ride saying , hey , this student on my bus is not there and there were rumors of injury and serious mishaps . So we had grief counselors at the schools and we 'll have them again on Monday . And I guess it 's not just kids who have passed away , but other people have parents who have passed away or parents who have injured or family members who have been injured . Beyond that . When children lose their sense of security -- and some children could be as young as kindergarten , first grade -- or even more adult students in high school . Their friends mean a lot to them . And loss of their stability , their home , their tradition of the way they run their day . You put your child to bed at night . You certainly do n't expect that the next morning there will be problems within your household . So it 's not just immediate problems . Its fears or thoughts that may crop up weeks from now with these kids . Right . And these times are tough for the children because they have big exams coming up . Sure . And we do n't want them to feel that the pressures that they have in the house and the fact that some may not even have a home impinge on what they 're trying to do in school . We 're trying to make the school as safe an environment as we can during these tough times . Well , it 's been , I know , a long day for you . And I appreciate you talking about it . And the school district is lucky to have you , Anna . Thanks . Thanks for being with us .
BC	You know , Larry , I have never , ever acquitted a client based on reasonable doubt . If you start talking to juries about reasonable doubt , what they say is , here 's the jury . Let me be the juror a minute . You know , Spence is out there talking about reasonable doubt . That 's just a cute lawyer trick . It really means that he 's guilty but he has n't proven him guilty enough . The prosecution has n't done its job quite well enough . But they know and we know and the defense knows and the defendant knows , everybody knows and we know that he 's guilty . So this reasonable doubt is just lawyer talk , and let 's get down to the nubbins here and get this case decided in accordance with justice . That 's what jurors do . Now , that being the case , I have the responsibility , contrary to the law , contrary to the business of presumption of innocence , I have the duty to prove my client innocent . And if I do n't carry that burden , my client is going to be convicted . I never heard it put that way . Do you agree , Mark ? There really is no presumption of innocence . There is no presumption of innocence . If you get somebody to be honest with you , when they see you next to your client on that side of the counsel table , virtually everyone will tell you , if they 're honest , you know , where there 's smoke there 's fire . If this guy did n't do it , why would he be here ? Or if he did n't do this , he did something else . So when you 're asking jurors , at least my experience , whether or not -- as you sit here , can you presume my client to be innocent and they say , oh , yes . And you say they just read off 15 charges in the indictment that charged him with all these heinous crimes . Do you have any reaction ? And the juror said , oh , no , I have no reaction at all . You know they 're lying through their teeth at you , and you have to understand that . I do n't know about Gerry , but I often prefer a juror that says , yes , when I looked at him , I figured there 's something here . Where there 's smoke there 's fire . At least then , I have somebody I can engage in an honest dialogue and they 're not lying through their teeth at you . Can I tell a story ? Yes , when we come back , we 'll tell the story . We 'll take a break . We 'll be right back . The book is " Beyond a Reasonable Doubt . " Do n't go away . Welcome back to this Super Bowl eve edition of "LARRY KING LIVE . " We 're discussing the book " Beyond a Reasonable Doubt . " I wrote the introduction . Owen LaFave has as wonderful book out , " Gorgeous Disaster , " the tragic story of Debra LaFave . All right , Gerry , what 's the story ? OK . I 'm defending a sheriff of having killed his undercover agent , shot him between his eyes in the back seat of the sheriff 's car . It 's been publicized all over . It 's been on "60 Minutes " and all the rest and everybody says this sheriff ought to be hung for killing his undercover agent . So I go to the jury and I begin to do just what Mark Geragos says . You 've read all this . Do you think he 's guilty ? Oh , no . Well , do you think he 's guilty ? Well , some of them say , well , yes . A few of them said yes . Some more of them said yes . Then a bunch of them said yes . Then there were three or four that said no .
BC	So the ads I saw -- and maybe this goes into that 50 percent -- I saw an editorial that said the reason why there` s so much slapstick this year is because America is just so tired of the war . This is our violence coming out . I saw that , too . I must really -- I must really not be that smart , because I never put together " The Three Stooges " quality with , you know , the malaise about the Iraqi war . You know , it` s not that , Dave . It` s that we do n` t have a life . It` s not that we`re -- we`re just not looking to make an issue out of absolutely nothing . I think that` s what it is . I`ll be honest . Sometimes articles like that do make me question my intelligence . I think is it me ? Is it me ? And here` s what I always come up with . Wow , it just is me . I guess I` m smarter than everybody else . Dave , thanks a lot . All right , buddy . Back with " The Real Story " in just a second . All right . Welcome to " The Real Story . " This is where we try to cut through the media spin and figure out why a story is actually important to you . Yesterday , most of us were watching the Super Bowl , but the hottest action was n` t on the field in Miami . The real story is that I`ve been telling you right here since last summer the Islamic extremist holy war is heating up , and the temperature is as hot as something that has not been seen since biblical times . From the shores of the Persian Gulf to those of England` s Thames to our own Lake Michigan , violence is escalating and putting us on the brink of World War III . Now , if for some reason you`re still in denial , I beg that you listen to this . What used to be a theory is quickly becoming a terrifying and irrefutable fact ! Iran` s president , Ahmadinejad , has just I guess gotten bored with yesterday` s big game so he planned his own Super Sunday . Next Sunday , February 11th , he` s going to reveal some of Iran` s giant achievement in science , including a cure for AIDS . Really ? Supposed to be herbal , they say . Something tells me it` s probably going to look a lot like a machete . And news also going to be announced of their nuclear progress . The real story is Iran is getting dangerously close to achieving nuclear capability . Too close for some of their neighbors , like Israel . Reports surfaced yesterday that Iran` s leading nuclear scientist has died under "mysterious circumstances . " U.S. intelligence sources reportedly cite very strong intelligence that he was assassinated by the Mossad , the Israeli security agency . Israel denies any involvement in this , but I`ve got to ask the question : Why would anyone in this country say that out loud , even if we had the proof ? If Iran should get a nuke , whether they buy one from the Soviets or make one of their own , Israel knows that their target number one , and we`re not far behind . I could n` t blame them if they did take aggressive steps to ensure their own safety . You know , by taking out Iran` s leading nutty professor , I` m OK with that . I just wish we have the same kind of commitment here in this country .
BC	That brings us to the subject of our poll tonight : should vaccinations against the STD Human Papilloma Virus be mandated for sixth-grade girls across the country in your opinion ? Yes or no , please cast your vote at loudobbs.com . We 'll have the results for you here later in the broadcast . Time now take a look at some of your thoughts . Bonny in Illinois said : " I read with disgust the president 's comments regarding CEO compensation . He said that it should be tied to the value provided to shareholders . Does n't this mean more of the same , companies so concerned about the shareholders that U.S. workers are forgotten ? " And Barbara in Ohio : " Bush lives in an upside-down world . Sending Border Patrol Agents to jail , presidential pardons for drug dealers , billions for Iraq , tax breaks for the rich , cut benefits and services for the poor and aged , with reductions in Medicare and Medicaid . Upside-down " And Delores in Texas : " We knew this would happen -- Ignacio Ramos , former Border Patrol agent , was recognized and beaten by other inmates on Saturday . What a travesty of justice for this man . " Send us your thoughts to loudobbs.com . More of your thoughts coming up here later in the broadcast . Each of your whose e-mail is read here receives a copy of my book , " War on the Middle Class " . Up next here , new legislation on Capitol Hill aimed at protecting America 's struggling middle class . We 'll have that story , tell you all about it . And arctic temperatures from the northern plains to New England have taken a deadly toll . We 'll have the very latest and the weather forecast for the nation upcoming . Stay with us . A love triangle has an elite NASA astronaut facing attempted murder charges tonight . The astronaut took off on a wild 900-mile dash across the country to confront the woman she thought was her rival in that triangle . The astronaut , Lisa Nowak , is free tonight on $ 25,000 bail facing charges of attempted murder . And now Kyung Lah with a report for us from Orlando , Florida -- Kyung . Well , Lou , bond was posted just a short time ago , about an hour ago . And that 's when Lisa Nowak , a NASA astronaut , did least jail here . Let 's give you a look at her as she is departing the jail . She was surrounded . She was the center of this throng of cameras and reporters . Her head was covered and then she slipped into a car and left . This was after her second hearing of the day , when she was charged with attempted first-degree murder . For the second mine a day , NASA astronaut Lisa Nowak faced charges , this one far more serious . Murder was the plan . And it just was not able to be carried out . In the charging affidavit , Orlando police say Nowak was carrying a black duffel bag . They say she approached an apparent romantic rival , Colleen Shipman , in a parking lot at Orlando Airport . Authorities say the bag contained a steel mallet , a Buck knife with a four inch blade and a bb gun that resembled a 9 millimeter . Nowak 's attorney told the court the physical evidence does not mean Nowak had intent to kill .
BC	That 's a really sad story . Let 's turn now and talk a little bit about business news . Miller wants beer drinkers to chill out . Twenty-five minutes past the hour . That means Stephanie Elam is " Minding Your Business . " Hey , Stephanie . Good morning . Hi , Soledad . That 's exactly it . Miller Brewing is now going to start selling cerveza , as it turns out . What 's going on here , next month they 're going to start selling -- or actually , I should say testing a beer that 's flavored with lime and salt in a few parts of the country . Specifically targeting Latino areas . And it 's calling it a modern American take on a Mexican classic . It 's a low-calorie beer called Miller Chill . And it 's modeled after a popular style of Mexican beer called Chelada . Now , it 's going to compete against other light beers , and it will be tested in Florida , Texas , Arizona , New Mexico , and in San Diego as well . They 're hoping to expand nationwide eventually . Now , moving on from there to a story about $ 6 million , it 's about poker , actually . It 's a dispute that has finally been settled and it has to do with this man named Jamie Gold , who won $ 12 million after winning the World Series of Poker main event last summer . He was then sued by Bruce Crispin Leyser , who is a television producer , actually , who claimed that Gold had promised him half of the money if he won . Now , Gold probably did not think he was actually going to win . The odds were totally against him . He 's not a pro when it comes to poker . And on top of it , 8,700 people were enrolled in this event overall . But now Gold has said that he has paid up . We do n't know , however , if he paid the exact full $ 6 million , but apparently both sides are happy about how things turned out . So I guess even if you do n't think you 're going to win , keep your mouth shut so you can keep your money . That 's the takeaway from that . There are so many instances where that takeaway is relevant . And it has -- I mean , I think a Chicago Bears player just went through that , too . So you 've got to be careful about what you say if you do n't mean it . You know ? Because you think you 're not going to win . Yes . The next thing you know , someone is suing you and you 're getting calls from lawyers . And they 'll call . They 'll remember . Yes , they will . That 's why they 're lawyers . All right . Stephanie Elam for us this morning . Thanks , Stephanie . ELA Sure . A look at the top stories of the morning are coming up next , including a developing story out of Iraq . Another U.S. helicopter has been shot down -- is down . Was it shot down , is the question now . We 're going to bring you the very latest on that story . And after his stunning fall from grace and three intense weeks of rehab , we 'll tell you what Pastor Ted Haggard now says is his next move . He 's got a completely heterosexual life , we 're told .
BC	Coming up on AMERICAN MORNING , it is Fashion Week in New York City . And our own fashionista , Alina Cho , is live in the middle of it all . She could n't be happier . Look at that smile . It 's her favorite assignment every year . Hello , Alina . Hi there , Miles . Behind the scenes , though , the real big story is business . Big business . I 'll have much more on this live from the tents when AMERICAN MORNING continues . Welcome back to the most news in the morning . Green is the new black , they say . At least during Fashion Week in New York City . Green , as in money . Fashion Week makes more than $ 200 million for New York City . Alina Cho goes behind the seams for us this morning . She 's at the tents at Bryant Park in New York . Hey . Good morning . Hey . Good morning , Soledad . First and foremost , Fashion Week is all about fashion . But , as you mentioned , it is also a huge moneymaker for the city of New York . It 's why major corporations come here . They road-test their products . And it 's also made the careers of more than a few famous designers . It 's a spectacle and some might say superficial , but Fashion Week is big business . It 's made Gilles Mendel 's career . I think I 'm , like , the best example , where , you know , my dream came true , and really a large part of my success is thanks to the shows . CH Before he started showing in the tents two years ago , Mendel was known as a furrier . He wanted the public to see he could make more than just coats . Very nice . So he crafted a collection for the runway . Each show costs him $ 400,000 -- and that 's twice a year . What he gets back is priceless . All the press all over the world take all those pictures and print them in every magazine , on the Internet , all over the world . Those pictures sell clothes . In two years , Mendel 's business has multiplied from $ 5 million a year to $ 30 million a year . It 's not just designers . Mercedes-Benz spends millions to be Fashion Week 's title sponsor . There are many others , including MAC Cosmetics , which supplies makeup and services to most of the shows . Why do they get involved ? In a word , branding . From runway to real ( ph ) way . I mean , really what you see is inspiration , looking forward to trends in the future , yet the reality of it is you 're seeing makeup created right now . In some ways , it 's an easy sell . One hundred thousand people come to the tents during Fashion Week , and the fashion crowd is a captive audience . They stay in good hotels . Fine restaurants . They go to the best restaurants . They check out every new restaurant . They go shopping . They know how to spend money . They like to spend money . Fashion Week generates an estimated $ 235 million for New York City over just eight days . Good for the economy , good for business , and very good for Gilles Mendel . The runway show has really transformed completely my company . And I really give thanks to those runway shows . You know , really living a dream .
BC	That 's the journalist in you . I always wanted to ad a ly every time I heard that to , differently . Yes , I know . Good morning , Soledad and Miles . And this is a story that we have been covering for two days now . And it just is not ending . First of all we have Apple , Steve Jobs , coming up and saying the music industry needs to get rid of their anti-piracy software . And then after that , the music industry said , hey , no , you need to loosen up your software . And now EMI , which is the record label behind ColdPlay , as well as the Rolling Stones , are saying , we 're looking at actually talking to online retailers and selling our entire digital music catalog to them . This is according to " The Wall Street Journal . " Let 's see how this plays out . But if that did happen , anyone who has an MP3 player would be able to play their music . Let 's move on and take a look at the view from Vista . Microsoft 's new operating system has been doing really well for PC sales . It turns out that PC sales rose 67 percent in U.S. retail stores in the first week on the market . Leading the charge was Hewlett-Packard . They saw their share of those sales up about 50 percent . Actually a little bit more than that . And so they did lead the industry with that . The last time a Windows operating system came out , it was XP in 2001 . Vista delayed twice . So people have been waiting around to upgrade to this one . Let 's move on and take a look that the markets yesterday . The Dow , a little bit on the down side , off about 29 points yesterday , down to 12,638. And that was hurt by indications of weaknesses in the housing market , despite some strong retail sales numbers , as well as earnings results . The Nasdaq was also off less than two points though at 2,488 . So we 'll have to see if we can end the week here on a positive note and see what happens today . Thank you , Stephanie . We 'll be watching it , no matter what happens . No matter . All right , Stephanie , thanks . Top stories of the morning are up next , including a startling new report on autism . We 'll tell you how common the disorder really is . Plus , we 're going to talk to the last reporter to interview Anna Nicole Smith , " Entertainment Tonight 's " Mark Steines . Did he see any signs of trouble ? You 're watching AMERICAN MORNING. The most news in the morning right here . The child who 's now been left behind . An autopsy today on Anna Nicole Smith and a new fight for the custody of her 5- month-old daughter . Extreme weather . Seven feet of snow on the ground in parts of the Northeast . More on the way . Sounding a new alarm on autism . The devastating condition is more common in children than was first thought . The new numbers straight ahead on this AMERICAN MORNING. Welcome back , everybody , Friday , February 9th . I 'm Soledad O'Brien .
BC	And so -- but what it did produce was this headline the next day in every paper that said , Senate Republicans block the debate . And I think that is instructive , because it does tell Americans that Congress , as an institution , as much as people thought the Democrats are taking over , this is a new direction , Congress as an institution is just not equipped to deal with issues like this . All right . Well , this is one story that 's not going away . And as you say , Katty Kay , it is driven by the still strong passions about this war and how we got into it . Katty Kay , Matthew Felling , Karen Tumulty , thanks very much for joining us . Up next , FOX vows to take on CNBC for business supremacy . And later , from Sunday morning talk show host , to star witness , Tim Russert on the hot seat at the Scooter Libby trial . Also , the mayor of San Francisco having an affair with an aide , heading into rehab . Why Arianna Huffington does n't think that 's much of a story . Time now for the latest from the news business in our " Media Minute . " Jeff Zucker has been ticketed for big things at NBC ever since he became executive producer of the " Today " show at the age of 26 . This week , the network announced , to no one 's great surprise , that Zucker will succeed Robert Wright as head of NBC Universal Television , making him the first person from the news division to ascend to the top job . We got a lot of e-mail this week saying we 've been too hard on CNBC 's Maria Bartiromo in that flap about whether she had gotten too cozy with an executive with Citigroup . But Rupert Murdoch says the network 's problem is that it 's too antagonistic toward business , too quick to leap on every scandal . Murdoch confirmed that he will enter the arena by launching a FOX business network by the end of the year . We wanted to be a little bit more business friendly , I think , than CNBC has been . There 's just an atmosphere to it that 's a little bit negative , I think . Fair and balanced coverage of the corporate world ? Well , never underestimate Murdoch . Ahead in the second half of RELIABLE SOURCES , NBC 's Tim Russert was the one getting grilled this week in the Scooter Libby trial . Plus , free speech philandering and flying . John Edwards ' inflammatory bloggers , Gavin Newsom 's San Francisco sex scandal , and Nancy Pelosi 's costly plane are all fodder for our blogging guests , Glenn Reynolds and Arianna Huffington . All that after a check of the hour 's top stories from the CNN Center in Atlanta . Welcome back . Tim Russert took the witness stand in the Scooter Libby perjury trial this week , and Libby 's lawyer suggested that he might have it in for the former Dick Cheney aide , playing a clip from " Imus in the Morning " shortly before the indictment was announced . TIM RUSSERT , HOST , " MEET THE PRESS" : It was like Christmas Eve here last night . You know , Santa Claus is coming tomorrow . Surprises -- what 's going to be under the tree ?
BC	Anna Nicole Smith . Why was n't she ... Well ... ... she was living with the baby . I think she went to Florida to look at a yacht for a short period of time . Well , here 's -- here 's -- here 's the question , though ... ... she died . ... though , Lisa . Why are so many men coming forward to claim paternity ? Are they just trying to wear this as a badge of honor ? No. Or are they after the money ? They think this is a $ 400 million baby . Yes . This is ... ... because she was entitled ... This is -- this is a financial ... ... to this huge judgment at one point . It was reversed to zero , then went up to $ 80 million , reversed to zero again . She won in the Supreme Court . Mm-hmm . So , she gets to keep fighting . And even if... That 's why . ... all the money ultimate goes to Dannielynn , the little baby , someone will have to be appointed a guardian for her ... Yes . ... who will have control of that money for years , and will be presumably paid some fee for being a guardian . So , even -- so , just being named the guardian and the -- you know , and the father would be the best candidate for -- for guardian -- you know , that 's a huge -- that 's a huge amount of money . Yes , they 're not just signing up for diaper duty . Well ... BLOO I think there 's a pot of gold ... Well , we do n't know , at this point , who the guardian is going to be , but , apparently , we have an idea of who the executor of the estate is going to be . And that 's Howard K. Stern . He said , in terms of his relationship with Anna Nicole Smith -- quote -- " I work for Anna exclusively , and I have for quite some time . I 'm proud of that fact . " Yes . A lawyer with one client who has an extreme conflict of interest in this case . Who he is sleeping with , yes . ... who was sleeping with her , who is also the executor of her will ? Yes , shameful behavior . Does that strike you as being a little odd ? Shameful , unethical in every state . And I wonder if someone is going to bring an action to say , he should n't be executor of her will . He had a conflict of interest in doing that . Who has standing to bring that lawsuit ? Well ... That 's the problem . You know , maybe the father of the baby , in the name of the baby . I mean , there 's so much litigation that 's ... ... she 's done before . Because the baby is the heir , correct ? The baby is clearly her legal heir . Well -- I mean , well , we do n't -- I mean , we assume it is , if that is what is in the will . I mean , if there 's a will , the will will say who is the heir . The will -- the will says Daniel . ROBERT Although , apparently , what was in the will was that the money went to Daniel , right , the son . Right .
BC	So now the issue became how do you sell the ring , right ? Exactly . I tried to go back to my jeweler to sell the ring , and they only wanted to give me 32 percent back . You know , I spent my life savings on this . You know , I ca n` t take a big loss like that . Oh , man . We`ve got to get you a woman . Are you all right now ? Yes , I` m actually -- you know , I` m dating someone right now . I`ve often heard it said , and I think you`re confirming this , that these engagement rings are like cars . You know , the minute you drive off the lot , the thing has decreased incredibly so in value . So it` s the same with diamond rings . Exactly . Same way . Except I think it decreases more . Are they tainted stones ? Aren` t they , like , hexed ? I mean , like , if the next one that you`re going to give it to , the next female that you`re going to , you know , odd the odds ( ph ) to , if she finds out this is a used ring that went south before , I do n` t know if that` s going to work . Well , I do n` t think that` s such a big deal to some people . Someone` s bad luck could be someone else` s good luck . Glass half full . Or you just do n` t tell her . You know ? Yes . You do n` t have to tell her . Also , you know , say you sell your ring back to a jewelry store . I guarantee that they take the diamond out and you can be buying someone else` s ring and you just do n` t know it . You know what ? That` s true . I mean , they never crush the stones . Right ? No. Chances are that ring has be on somebody` s finger at some point . And I never thought of that . Exactly . What do they go for on the web site ? How much will someone have to spend ? So far , I`ve been seeing this -- you`ll probably get 50 to 60 percent of your value . But we have rings on there from $ 600 to $ 19,000 . So it goes all ranges . And then what` s the house cut ? What` s the big ? We only take 5 percent of the ring . And then the reaction among jewelers ? I` m sure they`re not too thrilled to see you`ve entered the marketplace , so to speak ? You know , actually , some jewelers did n` t mind this . They do n` t get that much . You know , most of them do n`t , you know , sell back the ring anyway . But yes , I guess I` m taking away some business from the jewelry business . There` s always that battle : who gets the ring ? Is it hers to keep ? Is it -- you know , is it the guy who gave it to her ? And that goes on and on . It always gets litigated . Look , we thought it was important to have you here with this very happy Valentine` s Day story . So thank you , Joshua . Thank you . We`ll be back right after this . Why have Glenn read your hate mail when you can tell him to his face ?
BC	What do you make of this whole thing ? You know , Larry , my opinion is this is a whole circus going on here . I wish Anna would watch -- wherever she is -- first of all , I wish she would be still alive . She 's been dearly missed . And I think whoever is going to get the child , the judge will rule what 's in her best interest . I think what 's best for the baby , that 's what I think . You know , I see all this allegations about the little kid is going to be on a diet . Anna just wanted to have a healthy baby . She was obese once , you know . That 's why she got healthy and she lost all this weight . She trained . You liked her as a person , right ? She was of the nicest , kindest wonderful person . You know , nobody talks about the good stuff . I mean , she did so much for charity , for Make a Wish Foundation , for children , you know , who had one month to live , she took them to Disneyland . She did so much for the gay rights , for AIDS Foundation , for animal rights . I mean , nobody even mentioned anything . Just to mention a few . Cyrus , you were saying before we went on , that he can challenge the will , no matter what it says , right ? Because he wants to raise the baby ? Well , something to that effect . No matter who... It was her intent that whether he 's the father or not , that he have a hand in raising the -- and caring for the child . That 's what she ... KIN She said that to you ? A lot of times we laid on the bed together , like when she was five months pregnant , and talked about it . I would say , Anna , the little kid needs a father , right ? No, I can raise her by myself . I said , Anna , he needs a strong hand in the house here . And she said -- she looked at me and said , what about you ? I want you to make sure you 're here for ... And you would be willing to do that ? Definitely . This is half of Anna , really . You know , what you see . And this say beautiful kid . The reason Mr. Denk was around was because of -- obviously , she valued the personal training , his health , his attitude towards health . He trained her consistently . He was a symbol of protection . And she wanted a father figure of that nature , at least his influence at the very least to raise her child . What part in all of this do you play legally ? Does he go into court ? Do you wait to see the DNA ? Or does he submit a DNA , what ? Well , we 're going to wait and see what happens with the DNA testing . It is what it is . Supposing it tests and it 's not Howard and it 's not Larry and not the prince and not anyone we know . Then what ? He comes forward ? That 's actually possible . Of course . It 's actually possible . He 's going to come forward and he wants to care for the baby one way or the other because those were her wishes upon death .
BC	Because ... Would n't everyone want that done ? ... I mean the complicating factor is you 've got a California judge issuing a ruling that requires somebody living in the Bahamas to do something . And it gets really entangled , really complicated . And unless the other person is willing to do it , it 's a complicated legal matter . KIN All right , would n't it be helpful , Mark , if all the men who say they want to be the father voluntarily got together and said let 's all submit our DNA and we all want to know who it is for the benefit of the little girl , who 's the only one that counts ? Where are they going to do it , in a coliseum ? I mean at a... Well , how hard is it to do ? ... at a certain point , I mean there 's a lot of guys who are coming out and making that claim . I mean the -- and a lot of this is , is really more complicated than it has to be . I mean it -- it does not seem to me , at least , to be rocket science or very difficult for a judge to figure out , look , she had a will , she left all of it to her son . She bought a plot for her son . She bought a plot for herself next to where she buried her son . Hello ? Guess where she wanted to be buried ? And she did not want to be buried anywhere near her mother , obviously . And that 's why she buried her son there . So I mean that ... So this should be open and shut ? That should be open and shut . It 's far -- and I agree with you as far as the DNA . You 've got three guys . Get the DNA done . You can turn it around in three days . It 's the simplest thing in the world ... Would n't they want it done ? I do n't understand . Well , I do n't know . I mean ... Well , there 's one of them , Larry ... Somebody 's got to... What ? Larry , there 's one of them that clearly does not want it done , and that 's Howard Stern . That 's why they went to Bahamas in the first place ... Why not ? ... to avoid the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts . Because I think it 's pretty clear he 's not the biological father . What happened was Anna Nicole and Larry Birkhead had a relationship . She got pregnant . She told Larry that he was the father . He went to prenatal visits . He even went as a single dad to visits after they broke up . Then she decides she wants Howard Stern to be the dad . They move to the Bahamas to avoid the jurisdiction of U.S. courts , have the baby there and he 's been hiding from DNA tests that have been court ordered for the last five months . Meanwhile , Larry , he 's bonding with this baby for five months . He 's the only parent she knows now . And at some point I think it 's clear there 's going to be a court order saying that baby has got to be given to the biological dad . She 's going to have a new , strange parent in her life , somebody she 's never known . And all of that is because he 's been hiding from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts .
BC	Well , they 've gone back , they did multiple studies looking at that the and even just antidotaly , just look at the presidents of the United States for the part , it is up for debate , but some people thank god they 're smart and successful guys , they have been for the most part above average height . Only about five of them have been pretty far below average CEOs studies have shown are also taller as well . So there is a lot of evidence out there showing that taller people make more money . There are exceptions to the rule . Napoleon , a whole variety . And these kinds of studies cut both ways . I like to think that I do well not because I 'm tall but maybe I bring other goods to the game too . The height thing , though , it is n't just about how tall you are . What attributes you have from being tall , they think it is self - esteem and self-confidence . It is also how tall you were when you were 16 . You were 16 because it is when exactly you were forming your identity . So people that were short when they were 16 and had a growth spurt at 18 they 're left out of the boost in pay . It is still pretty shocking ; I think that we like to think that we 've come a long way . That we judge people on their results and their effectiveness . Especially at work where so many ways to measure it . When you look at something like this . I feel almost discouraged like you want to go out and do something . Well , you can do something to keep this in your bottom line . That 's to keep going to school . That 's what all the studies show . Interesting stuff . Thanks Jen . Coming up turning the page , we 'll talk to the founder of Black Enterprise Magazine about how his company is driving change in the workplace . Also ahead , love is stronger than labels . We 'll hear from former defense secretary William Cohen on a marriage that shattered societies barriers . Also ahead , concrete results , meet a south Bronx activist who is bringing green actism to the inner city . Now in the news , within the next half hour , Senate Democrats hope to repeat the victory of their house colleagues , they 're expected to take up a non-binding resolution , opposing the president 's plan on sending additional combat troops to Iraq . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice is now in Israel after doing damage control during a surprise to Baghdad . Rice told Iraqi leaders that despite the critics in Washington the American people honor the sacrifice of U.S. soldiers in Iraq . First step toward burial , the body of Anna Nicole Smith is embalmed ; her mother and her long time partner are still fighting over where Smith will be buried . And also fighting over her estate and who gets custody of her daughter . Sheered and tattooed bop star Britney Spears has a shiny new do or lack there of and two tiny tattoos . It is the latest in a string of attention getting stunts pulled by Spears since the beginning of the year .
BC	And I say we have to refocus the government to help the middle class . The average middle class person is not doing terribly , but for the first time in a long time ... Struggling . ... they 're worried about their future and , more importantly , their kids ' future . We compete against jobs in China and India . Our schools are n't as good as she they should be . Our healthcare is n't as good . Democrats are going to propose meat and potato things that I outline in the book that appeal to the middle class . So people would say it will end as we began , which is , depending on what happens with the war , though , is going to be how the votes go . The war -- let me tell you , this last vote , a CNN poll , I think , " USA Today , " 51 percent supported what the Democrats did , 19 percent supported the Republicans . They want us to keep at it . It does n't matter the specifics of the resolution , because we ca n't win any of those when the president has a veto power , 67 votes , but if we keep pressuring and debating -- the old congresses under Republicans did n't even debate this issue . Now we 're forcing the president to explain himself , to re - examine . He will have to change because his policy is a failure . And we 're going to keep at it . We 'll see if that works . Senator Chuck Schumer , nice to see you , as always . Nice to see you . Good morning . Thanks coming in and talking with us . Appreciate it . A pleasure . John . Thanks , Soledad .

It 's 25 minutes after the hour . Stephanie Elam here " Minding Your Business " this morning . Good morning , Stephanie . Good morning . Who thinks about the business angle of these things ? I do n't think many people do . Oh , it 's huge . But it really is a big one . For people who enjoy it , it 's really more about the fun . But let 's take a look at some of the things that happened at the Daytona 500 . It was the closest finish on record . It was very close , actually . Kevin Harvick won by two-one-hundredths of a second , beating out over Mark Martin . Harvick dives a Chevy , but there were actually several automakers who were in focus at Daytona . Let 's take a look at that . Starting off with Ford . Ford actually had nine cars in the race , and they say their total NASCAR spending is about $ 100 million . The company lost nearly $ 13 billion in 2006 , so you might wonder , is this really a good idea for them to be involved in that ? But they say they do n't stop their marketing efforts despite the fact that they have all those losses . You still have to do that in hard times .
BC	This judge is very much an individual . I think we all have to remember this is probate court . It is a probate proceeding , not a criminal proceeding , so it` s going to be a little bit more informal . But I think , really , this judge is making headway because he has appointed in a number of days a guardian for the child . He` s trying to determine the issue at hand , who should receive the body . She initially would not accept that Daniel was gone . And this went on for quite some time . It was quite a difficult process . You know , it was hard for her to talk about it , and she went through a lot of thought in deciding what his plans would be . And you know , throughout that time , the way that she went about it , it was never , Where is Daniel going to be ? All of the discussions were always in the context of , Where are we all going to be ? I` m Pat Lalama , sitting in for Nancy Grace , just sitting here , trying to make some sense out of a plethora of issues . Who knew one person` s life could end up quite like this . I want to go back to medical examiner Joshua Perper . You know , a question was raised to me , and I` m going to pass it along here . Do we know exactly how much time elapsed before Anna Nicole was last seen feeling great and looking good , and suddenly , she was a collapsed human being ? Well , we know that she was seen last time at about 11:00 o`clock in the morning . And then for two hours , apparently she was not seen . She was in bed . And by the time -- at 1:00 o`clock , she was found collapsed . So this is the interval of time when the collapse , and apparently , the death occurred . Anna in a lot of ways always thought she was going to die young . She said that she thought she was going to be like Marilyn Monroe , so she thought she was going to die . And then also thought she was going to die when she was giving birth to Dannielynn , so Anna did talk about death . She talked about death , really from the time that I met her . Sad , sad , and very true . I` m Pat Lalama in for Nancy Grace tonight . I want to go back to James Neavitt who represents Howard K. Stern in the California paternity matter . Just to clarify -- I do n` t know if I asked you this clearly enough -- I want the viewers to understand that tomorrow was to be a deadline for DNA sampling , correct me if I` m wrong , from Anna and from the baby . Now that Anna has passed , where do we stand now ? JAMES NEAVITT , HOWARD K. STERN` S ATTORNE Well , that` s an interesting question . The court did not change that order ; that order still exists . But the question is , you know , who is the order directed to ? And the court specifically said that he was n` t going to answer that question .
BC	We welcome you back . Defense attorney Lauren Lake , and Roland Martin , host of " The Roland S. Martin Show " on WVON Radio in Chicago . Now , you guys have got to admit , these images of these women are disgusting . Who can defend degradation of women like we have just seen in the video ? ROLAND MARTIN , EXECUTIVE EDITOR , " THE CHICAGO DEFENDER" : Hugh Hefner can , the publishers of " Maxim , " of " Stuff , " of " FHM. " And , so , they 're the ones who defend it . It is indefensible , because the images are being beamed across the world . And , so , an impression of black women -- of black women is being presented across the world . But we have an issue with the degrading of women in this country . You go to a boxing match , you see a woman in a bikini walking around with a ring card . That 's not hip-hop . That 's boxing . All right . And , so , we see it in our society . But is n't there a degree of offensiveness we 're talking about ? We just saw in that video this man swiping a credit card on this woman 's behind . That is so ridiculous and so degrading . Absolutely . And , I think , at a certain point , we just have to keep it real . It 's gone too far , in many ways . And what I implore , and what I 'm begging my brothers to do , and my white rappers , and my ... Hispanic rappers . ... Hispanic rappers , respect the women who have birthed you . OK ? We are your mothers . OK ? Everybody -- all men love their mama , but they 'll talk about a girl like a dog . That 's got to change . We are the women of this culture . For you to degrade us in that way , and for the women to accept that kind of treatment , I think is irresponsible . And quit playing naive . You know you 're not going up in there to model . You know what you 're modeling . All right . But you talk about women accepting responsibility for this . How about the guys that are making these records ? And we heard in one of the last segments that you 're not going to make any money off these records that have a social conscience message . Of course . And that 's a great point . It 's off this naked stuff . Exactly right . They 're both making a great point . That is , first of all , misogyny and sexism are big business in American culture . The degrading of women is from time and memorial . So the hip-hop visualizes it and vocalizes it in a very violent fashion . I have no defense for that -- misogyny , which is the hatred of women ; sexism , sentiments expressed against women because they 're women ; and patriarchy , which assumes that the man 's life supplies the norms to everybody else . So there 's no question about that . But here 's the problem -- that if you go to an average church , that many of these people are standing up to talk about the degradation of women , they 're hearing a gospel that says women should be subordinate to men . Now , they 're not as violent , as vicious , or as vocal as hip-hop , but they 're saying the same thing . And at the end of the day , you are not equal to this man right here .
BC	When you look at the numbers , the United States accepted just 202 refugees from Iraq last year , even though they had 70,000 slots open . " SARAH , " IRAQI REFUGE That 's shocking . Afraid for her family 's safety , she asked we not use her real name . So , we will call her " Sarah . " She believes her family was targeted because they are Christians . One day in Iraq , she woke up to gunfire . There were bullets rushing at home . Someone was firing at home . When did you say , " I must leave " ? We started to notice that there is a car following us . It was following us for a long time . We noticed that there are three men in the car . They were -- they were carrying guns , and they were aiming the guns toward us . They started shooting . The U.N. says there are nearly four million Iraqi refugees today . The overwhelming majority of them fled their homes after the war began . Tens of thousands more flee every month . Yet , fewer than 500 Iraqi refugees have been admitted to the U.S. in the last four years . This year , the U.S. plans to accept 7,000 Iraqi refugees , too few for Sarah , but this is politics , so it 's too many for others . Republican Congressman Tom Tancredo warned President Bush , accepting refugees "would be a colossal mistake , and would very likely violate U.S. law . " And , just last week , Democratic Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio , who opposed the Iraq war as a U.S. House member , said : " I think Ohio and Ohioans have contributed a lot to Iraq , in terms of blood , sweat and too many tears . I would not want to ask Ohioans to accept a greater burden than they already have borne for the Bush administration 's failed policies . " Ohio has lost 138 soldiers in Iraq . On Monday , Governor Strickland tried to clarify his remarks . Seven thousand Iraqis , out of several million , is an insignificant response to a huge problem . And that 's what I was trying to say . And I believe my comments have been misunderstood . And now the governor seems to be saying the opposite of his original position . Today , he told us , " My administration and Ohio would welcome innocent Iraqi civilians who are fleeing their war-torn country . " Many Iraqis requesting visas have been helping U.S. troops in Iraq , but that 's risky , and sometimes the ultimate sacrifice . Senators have heard testimony about beheadings , after terrorists forced those sympathetic Iraqis to confess they were spies working for the U.S. Is there some sort of moral obligation on the part of the U.S. to help ... Definitely . I mean , they came to the ... ... people like you ? They came to the country . They took out the old regime . And they should have more moral responsibilities toward the Iraqi people . It took six months , but Sarah got her visa to the U.S. She now lives with her uncle in New Jersey . She 's thankful she 's here , but angry she 's separated from her family . The U.S. did n't grant any of them a visa . Do you wish Iraq had never been invaded ?
BN	But there have been , certainly , in Mato Gross , there 's been shown to be a reasonably strong link between deforestation and soy farming . You are trying , your organization is trying to limit it with a kind of 1/5-4/5 program . Farmers who own land are encouraged and allowed to use 1/5 of it for soybean farming while reserving 4/5 of it as rainforest . Have I got that right ? And more importantly , is it working ? Is it working in a significant way ? The Brazilian forest code is quite specific about the legal obligations of agricultural producers , and in the Amazon , they 're obliged to maintain 80 percent of their land holding in native vegetation or native forest , if you like . If they do n't have that 80 percent , then they 're meant to acquire areas that will bring them up to that 80 percent threshold . So the work that we 're doing with Cargill and the general message we spread to other countries , is that they need to be compliant with Brazilian environmental legislation . It would not be acceptable in the United States to be buying soy from producers who were not compliant with U.S. environmental legislation . I 'm going to interrupt you , though , because the legal obligation is one thing . There are vast areas of the Amazon that are lawless . How are you doing ? Is it really working ? It 's precisely because of the lawlessness of the Amazon that we find ourselves talking to companies like Cargill . You know , the Amazon is increasingly being pulled into world markets , and the fact of the matter is , is that if you 're having goods produced for export to places like Europe , where consumers are worried about the environmental implications of what they 're consuming , and if you have to present the presence of companies , like Cargill , who are actually rather sensitive to problem for their image that events in the Amazon can cause , then you have new pressure points that environmental groups like ourselves can take advantage of . And I think , you know , we can work with the companies to try and encourage them to only source from producers who are compliant with the actually rather good Brazilian environmental legislation . And yet , forgive me for interrupting , Cargill is saying that it is refusing to buy soybeans off land that was illegally cleared before July 2006 . Essentially what they 're saying is ... Yes , that 's a moratorium on further cultivation , which is something we 've been trying to get Cargill to agree to for a number of years . That 's forward looking , and probably important , but is n't it essentially allowing anyone who has already broken the law , anyone who has already violated the environment , to get rich ? And saying that we will not allow anyone else to do this perhaps for the next two years , but everyone who has already done it , we 'll buy plenty of soybeans if you can grow them . I think that there 's a great deal -- in the Amazon , there is a large number of land that 's already been cleared a long time ago . There 's plenty of opportunity for grain producers to grow grain on land that was cleared , you know , 15 , 20 , 30 years ago .
BN	Hello , everyone . I 'm Kyra Phillips , live at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta . And I 'm Don Lemon . Chewing the fat over the size of a former supermodel . Tyra Banks says , get over it , her scale goes up and down like everybody else 's . What do you think about America 's obsession with weight ? We 're reading your e-mails straight ahead , right here in the CNN NEWSROOM. 2:30 Eastern time , T.J. Holmes working details on a developing story for us -- T.J. ? Yes Kyra , we continue to follow and update this story for you out of West Virginia . In Ghent , West Virginia , where there has been an explosion at a gas station there that has killed at least four people and the sheriff there tells us that they could -- that number could go higher , as many as seven possibly killed . What happened they believe here this morning is that there was a leak , a gas leak in a propane tank here at the Flat Top Little General Store again in Ghent , West Virginia . Authorities were called to the scene . As soon as authorities got there , the explosion happened , essentially wiping out just about completely this entire gas station with the people that were there . You are seeing this video . There used to be a gas station there . You ca n't make out anything , any semblance of a gas station there right now . We talked to the sheriff , Danny Moore , a short time ago here live . Here 's some of what he had to say about the situation they have there . Actually , we do n't have the sound from him right now , but the sheriff Danny Moore said he 's going to have to go through . What they are doing is the task of having to go through a lot of the debris and rubble and they do n't know -- they could find out , of course , find out how many people were working . How many people were on shift at that time . What they do n't know is exactly how many people may have just stopped in , how many customers may have been there . So they certainly would n't be surprised and could possibly find more people under that rubble . But we 're keeping an eye on this . But at least we know of four dead after a gas station explosion at a gas station there in Ghent , West Virginia . We 've been following this story for some time . We 'll continue to follow it and bring you those developments , Kyra . All right T.J. , thanks a lot . And just back from Iraq , Democratic Congressman Tom Lantos is offering a grim view of the war and the Iraqi leadership . The head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee was part of a delegation led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi . He says Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is a long way from being the right man for the job . In the CNN NEWSROOM this morning , Lantos also called President Bush 's troop escalation plan a mistaken policy . I strongly favor deescalating for a tremendous range of reasons . One of them being the global security position of the United States . We have no strategic reserve . Iraq is not the only danger point we face and to try to salvage an operation where so many fundamental mistakes have been made for so long a period is a wrong-headed policy .
BN	But , in a place where religion so often sparks violence , it was religion alone that ruled the day . Michael Holmes joins us from Baghdad . Michael , as always , great to see you . A couple of questions . Let 's play a little what if game here . What if you walk down that same street with your crew in say a week from now without that sheikh there or any U.S. troops ? Probably a different result , I think it 's fair to say , Tony . It 's important to understand that there are varying -- this is an area that is largely under the control of the Mehdi militia , Muqtada al-Sadr 's group . But there are shades of gray with the Mehdi militia . In Sadr City , very hard line . In Kadamia , not so much . They are hard lined , but not as hard lined as the others . So -- but I still think that without the sheikh there , we would n't have got very far down that street without , at the very least , being told to leave . It also highlights the importance of tribal power in this country , which it 's been said for a long time the U.S. has n't fully understand , that sheikh rules in that area . Tony . Hey , Michael , you mentioned to the colonel in your story that things were different a couple of mile away , across the river . Explain that one for us . Well , it was interesting . I raised that because just two days -- the day before , in fact , for two days we had been in an area called Amamia ( ph ) , which is a Sunni stronghold , probably the most dangerous suburb in all of Baghdad , hanging out with Charlie Company at a place called Father Patchy , which is literally a house in the middle of the suburb . The soldiers call it the Alamo . They have daily attacks there . Grenade attacks . Rocket launch ( ph ) . So and that 's literally just across the river . And if you walked over there , you would last about five minutes . So a great difference by comparison just crossing the river . It was amazing . Brother . Michael Holmes for us in Baghdad . Michael , great to see you . Thank you . Tens of millions of your tax dollars wasted . That 's according to a quarterly audit of Iraq reconstruction aid . It 's being released today . Some examples from the report now . $ 43 million spent on a residential camp for police training . It has stood empty for months . About $ 4 million of that money said to be improperly spent on VIP trailers and an Olympic-size swimming pool . According to the report , those were ordered but Iraqi officials but never authorized by the U.S. And the report says more than $ 36 million was spent for weapons , like armored vehicles and body armor that cannot be accounted for . And still to come , a warning about global warming . It 's as if we 're standing in a swimming pool with the water up to our chest . When the temperature rises , now the water is up to our chin or our nose and every little wave is going to mean that it 's over our heads .
BN	We 're still following developments with a commercial Adam Air passenger plane - this story out of Jakarta in Indonesia - with more than 100 people aboard , lost contact with flight controllers on flight between a pair of Indonesian islands . Aviation authorities are gathering information from other flights at this time , which might have picked up a plane 's distress signal . The missing plane is a Boeing 737 carrying six crew and 96 passengers , including 11 children . That 's the latest on that story . We will continue to follow developments there .

This morning a little after two o'clock , there was a limousine heading northbound on Speer Boulevard when a car pulled aside their - or a vehicle pulled up aside it and fired multiple shots into the vehicle . There were three people on board - there were three people that were struck that were on board the limousine . And at this point in time , two have been transported to the hospital and another was transported . He was pronounced dead at the scene . Williams was in his second year with the Broncos . He was 24 years old . We 'll continue to follow developments in that story . In Washington now , live pictures from the Rotunda of the nation 's Capitol where the body of former President Gerald Ford lies in state , an honor guard keeping watch . The casket arrived at the capital on Saturday for an official state funeral . Mourners have been reflecting on Ford 's contributions to the country , including the pardoning of Richard Nixon .

He collapsed Saturday during a service at the Capitol . The 84-year-old Broomfield was attended by Senator Bill Frist , who is a surgeon . The Capitol doctor took over and Broomfield was taken to the hospital . Broomfield served in Congress with President Ford .
BN	They insisted that the Iraqi law be followed to the extent that they could . They were very careful about the physical custody aspect . They were very concerned about any attempt to free him at the last minute . Once they surrendered him , Saddam Hussein , they lost control of the event . And what followed , of course , as everybody who has seen the video tapes was a blatantly sectarian event . A bullying hanging , that is extremely disturbing , I think , to all those who hoped for a better outcome for the United States here . And we saw the official video , that was on Iraqi television , that tried to show a more dignified execution , but then , there was that cell phone video , that was released , that you could clearly hear the taunting , and the cries of " Muqtada , " references to Muqtada al Sadr , the radical Shiite cleric , who 's very powerful in Iraq right now , and as you point out , this was simply fuel the hatred between the Shia majority in Iraq and the Sunni minority . Yes , indeed . And as you know , the United States , the United States military command , the United States embassy in Iraq , have been trying very hard to get the Maliki government , the new Shiite government of Iraq , to behave in a way that is less sectarian . More uniting . And to have seen how they allowed this to degenerate as it did , an event which , by the way , was very much personally controlled by Mr. Maliki . He was engaged right up to the point , really , that Saddam arrived at the Hadamiya ( ph ) prison . He assigned the officials that were present , some of whom engaged in this taunting , and at the end , when the body was then delivered to Saddam 's tribe , where did they pick it up , but right in the forecourt of Mr. Maliki 's office . So this was a very much politically-controlled event that could have hardly been a more , if you will , distressing of how little this government is prepared to act in the name of all Iraqis , and in terms of the principles of the civil society that I think we all thought America was trying to construct here . And , you know , the interesting thing , also , is that United States military had control of Saddam Hussein , up until almost the very minute when he was handed over for hanging , for the execution , and then shortly after he died , the U.S. got him back . It was a U.S. military operation that flew that coffin to -- near his hometown of Tikrit which suggests to a lot of Sunni Arabs out there in Iraq and elsewhere the U.S. will be complicit in what they see as a calamity , if you will . I think this goes both ways . It 's certainly true that the United States is still widely blamed , on all sides here for things that go wrong , and among Sunnis , they will be blamed for having in effect connived at the humiliation of Saddam Hussein . On the other hand , there 's been a most remarkable transformation in the last year , with the Sunni community , the now minority community , the usurped , if you will , community , coming to see the American military as their protectors .
BN	Walter Mears , you won a Pulitzer Prize for your coverage of the era when you were the Washington -- you later became the Washington bureau chief of the Associated Press . That headline in " The New York Daily News , " " Ford To New York , Drop Dead , " do you agree with Jeff that that was in part responsible for Gerald Ford 's losing New York state ? No, I have to differ there . If Gerald Ford could have carried New York , I think , you know , he would have had a landslide . But the striking thing about that election was that Gerald Ford came within two percentage points of beating Jimmy Carter . And if you tried to make book on that election a year in advance , you would have had to say the party of the president who would resign , the appointed vice president , the party that in the last 49 House seats in 1974 , that the Republicans were going to go down by a wide margin . Ford very nearly pulled it off . Do you think that the decision he made to dump Nelson Rockefeller as his running mate helped or hurt him when all was said and done ? I think it helped him in the primaries . He had a really hard time with Ronald Reagan , as you know , in the primaries . It wound up that Ford won 15 primaries , Reagan won 12 . Ford was nominate by only 117 vote margin at that national convention . So I think Rocky had to go because the conservatives were too powerful and their enmity toward Rockefeller after all those years was too great . And , of course , the pardon was always a burden . Ford never second guessed himself on that . At the time that he issued it , he told his own people , I know this may cost me politically , but it 's the right thing to do . And with historic hindsight , a lot of people have come to agree , even those who were very , very adamantly opposed to that pardon at the time . It 's interesting , Walter , that Nancy Reagan , the former first lady , the widow of the late President Ronald Reagan , has made this journey to Washington . She does n't come here to Washington very often these days , but she wanted to pay her personal respects as well . Well , it 's worth remembering that Gerald Ford 's moment on the national stage did not end when he left the White House . There was that incredible sequence at the Republican convention in Detroit when Ford very narrowly was Reagan 's choice to run with him on the 1980 ticket . If the Ford people had n't insisted on basically making him co-president , they might have brought that off . That was a historic note . Condoleezza Rice , we saw there , Jeff Greenfield . Now Gerald Ford was the longest serving , the longest -- the oldest ex-president until he passed away . He beat Ronald Reagan , but not by much . Now the two oldest former presidents are George Herbert Walker Bush . He 's a few months older than Jimmy Carter . Both of whom are there right now as well .
BN	And with Democrats set to take control of Congress this week , that message , that Pelosi places a premium on family values , is one that she , and her party , hope will resonate with middle-class America , John . Interesting story . Andrea Koppel , thanks very much . In our next hour we 'll go home to Searchlight , Nevada with Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid -- Soledad . Coming up this morning , another major chain joins in the transfat revolution . Ali Velshi is " Minding Your Business " , straight ahead with that story . And the show of support for those New Orleans police officers now charged in the deaths of two men in the chaos after Hurricane Katrina . That story is straight ahead . Stay with us . Well , first it was doughnuts , then fried chicken , now your favorite Starbucks muffin will be transfat free . It 's 25 after the hour , Ali Velshi is here serving up some tasty business news . We love a guy who brings food , in the morning , Ali . Some folks may not like this whole move to transfat , but I do . Because this is a gratuitous reason to bring food on television , and eat it whenever you want . Bring it on , man . And here 's the thing , I ca n't tell you which ones of these are transfat . This is Starbucks . Starbucks announced that as of today , at half of its stand-alone stores -- Usually if they bounce , they 're transfat . I ca n't tell the difference . But at half of its stand - alone stores , 5,600 Starbucks stores in the United States , half of them -- the ones that Starbucks operates -- Definitely transfat free . This is really transfat free ? Because as of today -- It 's either that , or it 's stale . No, we just got them . I ca n't imagine it 's stale . This is good . Got it across the road , they are making the move to getting rid of transfat , which is partially hydrogenated oil , which I grew thinking was OK , but apparently raises the bad cholesterol , lowers the good cholesterol . And , you know , in New York City , they 're banning these things anyway . Wendy 's is turned off of transfat . KFC and Taco Bell are going off of it . And in all the major cities , Starbucks stand-alone units , in all the major cities , as of today , should have transfat-free muffins , doughnuts , pastries , that sort of thing . The rest of them , hopefully , by the end of year . You know , they 're just trying to save us from ourselves , and I 'm not sure that we need that . You necessarily want to be saved . I do n't want to be saved . I do n't need to be saved . The problem is -- Do you need to be saved ? Absolutely . I definitely need to be saved . Anybody who 's watched me eat through a couple pregnancies knows that . And you know what ? It is so much better for you , it 's going to save a lot of money , eventually , hopefully in health care costs . I 'm all for it . There you go . Enjoy the transfat , we 've got a little show to go still . I do n't know if it 's transfat free or not , but it 's really good .

Welcome back , everybody . It is Thursday , January 4th . I 'm Soledad O'Brien on Capitol Hill . It 's such a pretty , pretty shot when they take that shot on the capitol . It 's a gorgeous day out here today , John . Good morning . It really is nice . It is a fabulous day to be outside today . Maybe a little bit breezy , but where you are , that 's the place to be , Soledad . Good morning , I 'm John Roberts in our Washington bureau , in for Miles O'Brien this week . In Iraq this morning , a second guard is now being held by the Iraqi government , in addition to the man , it says , shot that cell phone video of Saddam Hussein 's final moments . CNN 's Arwa Damon is live for us in Baghdad this morning . Good morning , Arwa . Good morning , Soledad . And the Iraqi government is also saying that it is not to blame for that highly controversial cell phone footage , saying that the blame lies with the individuals who shot the footage and allowed it to be distributed . These chilling uncensured images of Saddam Hussein 's final moments are at the center of an awkward Iraqi government investigation , into itself and all that went wrong with the execution of Saddam . The government has said that it detained two security guards it says could be responsible for filming and distributing these images . The guards are employees of the prison where the execution took place , the former military intelligence headquarters under Saddam , located in Khadmiye , in northern Baghdad . Others might also be detained as the investigation continues . It was meant to be a day that the government would hail as a success , in fact the day of the execution Iraq 's national security adviser , who was present as Saddam fell to his death told CNN. There was absolutely no humiliation to Saddam Hussein when he was alive and after he was executed .
BN	Susan , that 's a really cool looking car , do n't you think ? Yes , that 's right . And it -- you know , it 's got an interesting history because they brought the -- GM introduced the Camaro to compete with Ford 's Mustang . And then Ford brought the Mustang back , and GM said , " Hey , you know , we like how this new vintage Mustang is doing . We 're going to do the same thing . " So they 're hoping that it will catch on and be a convertible , just like we see convertible Mustangs . The auto show is in the works somewhere , right ? Can we -- is Ali going to an auto show or something ? Is he ? I could see Ali at the auto show . I think it 's Sunday is when that car will be officially unveiled . So we 'll get pictures of Ali in the convertible with probably lots of ladies in the back seat . Hopefully , he brings one home , too , to both of us . Kyra 's laughing over here . Hopefully , he brings us all a car . Kyra and me in the back seat , I could see that , yes . Oh , yes . Taking it to Vegas . That 's what I 'm talking about . Yes . We keep talking about it .

Hello , everyone . I 'm Kyra Phillips at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta . And I 'm Don Lemon . Even if it was n't a tornado , well , it might as well have been . Louisiana is picking up the pieces after strong storms ripped right through that state . Now the trouble 's headed east . You 're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. Stormy day across the south . Several counties in and around Atlanta were briefly under tornado warnings . Strong winds brought down trees and power lines just south of the city . Some people think it was a tornado . No word of anyone seriously hurt . Atlanta 's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport , the world 's busiest , was on alert for a short time ; delays but no damage . And states of emergency in four Louisiana parishes after tornadoes that killed at least two people and injured 15 others . Trees are uprooted , roofs torn off , mobile homes knocked off their foundations . Me and my little cousin , when we heard the thunderstorm we ran under the table with my sister and her friend , her mama . And we just heard a big old thunderstorm . So we went out . They had all kinds of trees everywhere , ambulances and fire trucks . I was in my mobile home when it -- when the tornado hit and it flipped a couple times , and we just lucky to get out , get out alive . A solo sail around the world is going to have to wait .

BN	I mean , we have avalanches that , because we control these , they 're just not as large as this one . I mean , this one has obviously built up over time . And for our crews to be commenting that it 's so unusual and massive , this has taken everyone by surprise . Stacey Stegman of CDOT , thanks so much . We want to bring in our Bonnie Schneider . You 've been reporting on the weather that folks in Colorado , particularly around the Denver area , have been experiencing in the past couple of weeks . But this one , just as we heard from Ms. Stegman , is pretty alarming , to have an avalanche of this size on this pass . Yes . That 's right , Fredricka . All right . Bonnie Schneider , thanks so much . We 'll be checking back with you . Again , if you 're just now joining us , just west of Denver , the big concern right now is a very sizable avalanche which has buried vehicles on US 40 , which is just about 60 miles west of Denver . The location of this avalanche at Berthoud Pass . And it 's significant , because a number of vehicles were buried . But the good news , according to highway officials , is that at least six people were actually rescued , one person injured . But , because they 're dealing with at least 15 feet of snow and debris piled up on that part of the pass , now they are conducting searches to make sure that they can get to anyone else who may potentially have been impacted by this avalanche . We 'll have more on this story in a moment . Hello again . I 'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta . We 're watching a story in Colorado just outside Denver . A massive avalanche has occurred . What 's unusual here is that this avalanche has directly impacted U.S. 40 which is a highway which is frequented by a number of people , at least in this particular area , who are on their way to winter park ski resort . The avalanche took place at about -- between 10:00 and 10:30 Colorado time . And the highway authorities tell us what is encouraging about that time frame is that a number of people were probably already crowding the roads earlier . But unfortunately this avalanche did impact at least two vehicles and six people were rescued from their vehicles being buried from this snow , snow believed to be at least 15 feet deep along with a lot of debris that has impacted this U.S. 40 highway just outside of Denver . Our Bonnie Schneider is watching the weather conditions because one big concern right now is the continuing snow advisory where high winds are impacting the situation there , perhaps even helping to trigger this avalanche , Bonnie ? Really , it 's tough to say what triggered it . But the winds that are happening right now certainly not helping the situation . Because the winds are going to be fierce straight through Sunday . We have a blowing snow advisory for a good portion of Colorado , really through the foothills the front range . And you can see this actually extends into Sunday . With good reason . Some of the sustained winds we 're getting now are west at 25 miles per hour . But gusts could climb as high as 60 miles per hour over the next 24 hours . So blowing snow is in the forecast today , tonight , tomorrow . Even though we 're getting partly cloudy conditions in the Denver area right now , once you start driving further along i-70 to the west , that 's where we 're seeing the winds pick up at the higher elevations . So that will be the concern .
BN	The New York Stock Exchange says since no action has been taken against CNOOC , quote , " We do n't comment on hypotheticals . " But as the Treasury Department aggressively tries to isolate Iran foreign companies using American capital markets are injecting funds into a country with a long list of dangerous ambitions . Like , sponsor terrorism in Iraq , destabilizing that country , taking over Lebanon , building nuclear weapons , buying ballistic missiles and the like . C-nouk in Beijing did not answer e-mails seeking comment . By law this proposed C-nouk deal requires the president to launch an investigation to determine what sanctions apply . Congress is also looking into the matter . It 's on the top of the agenda for the House Foreign Relations Committee . Christine Romans , CNN, New York . For more on communist China 's moves to extend its geopolitical and economic influence around the world I talked with Congressman Tom Lantos , he is the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . And the congressman , well I asked him what he 's going to do about China 's actions . We have a law on the books and it 's up to the administration to fully enforce it . Next week I am calling Secretary Rice to get an assurance from her that sanctions will be imposed on China if China goes ahead with its plan to put $ 16 billion into Iran , which obviously will be used , least in part , to develop nuclear weapons . The administration has a legal obligation to place sanctions on Iran . This has not been done in the past . And I will insist that it be done and if the answer is unsatisfactory , I will hold early hearings on this subject . Will you also consider whether or not the administration , as required by law , irrespective of its powers permitted under that law to ultimately waive sanctions ? It is required under law to begin an investigation immediately . Will you also be looking into when that investigation began , whether it began at all ? Absolutely . And I will seek assurance from the secretary of state that the sanctions will not be waived . We simply cannot allow China to supply Iran with billions of dollars to be used for the development of nuclear weapons . As chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Congressman Lantos , one of great voids , some would argue many voids in U.S. policy has been focus in clear strategy in the Western Hemisphere , moving if I may quickly from the Middle East , but Central and South America have been all but ignored in the minds of many , by this government . Are you going to , as well , focus on that issue ? One of our highest priorities will be developments in our own hemisphere . The most serious problem obviously is Venezuela where Hugo Chavez goes out of his way to insult and attack the United States . Let 's turn to the 100-hour priorities of the speaker , Nancy Pelosi , wants a great deal accomplished in quick order . Are you confident that she and the Democrats will be successful in the House and then ultimately in the Senate ?
BN	See , I think we should begin by saying , what do we agree on ? We all agree that status quo wo n't do . We 've got to change the dynamics here . Then the question is , how do you do that ? A lot of people say , we want a different political situation , the economic situation , infrastructure 's not what it should be . All right , the question is , how do you achieve that ? I think you 've got to have people secure or feeling more secure in order to make the political and the economic progress that you seek . So you 're going in with an open mind on both sides . I want to see what the plan is . I think it makes sense to wait . I think a lot of people are anticipating everything the president may propose . They may be surprised . Do you have an open mind on what the president may say ? I do n't know what he 'll say . But what I know from the reports , looks like this has been done before . And also , it totally contradicts what our generals on the ground said to us in Senate testimony to the Armed Services Committee in November , when General Abizaid said he checked with every single commander on the ground , and to a person , they did n't think it was right to escalate the presence of American troops . But I do agree with Trent , and maybe I 'm reading too much into it . But he says he wants to look at this . And that 's what John Warner said . John Warner is now the ranking member of Armed Services . He says , look , it 's taken the president weeks and weeks to come up with this . The Congress ought to have a chance to look at this . And frankly , I 'd like to have a vote on this , you know , whether we want to escalate the number of troops in there . My own view is , that 's the wrong way to go . But we ought to have a vote . I hope the president comes to us . But when you say have a vote , he 's the commander in chief . He makes these decisions . You can decide whether to fund -- whether you can appropriate the money to pay for it , but as far as I know , you ca n't make that kind of a decision in the Congress . You can have a sense in the Senate resolution . That 's not my understanding . It 's non-binding . My belief is , the president 's coming to us . He 's going to ask for billions and billions of dollars . He 's going to send more of our people into harm 's way . I think it would be best for the country if we got to vote on that surge or escalation . And there 's nothing against that in the constitution . We do have the power of the purse . So you want to use that power of the purse ? I want to use it in terms of whether or not we should fund this escalation if , in fact , that 's what the president does . I think it 's an appropriate time -- and I believe John Warner has basically said this -- to come back to the Congress . Let us take a look at this , as Trent says , and I think let us vote . Let us vote .
BN	And I 'm glad to see you . Nice to see you . We have n't been together for a little while . It has been a little while . Good to be back . Nice holiday , nice Christmas , nice New Year 's , blah , blah , blah . All that stuff . We 'll talk about that later . All right . Talk amongst yourselves . All right . Happening this morning , south of Atlanta , they 're clearing trees and downed power lines . Twenty homes damaged , a half - dozen destroyed by a suspected tornado in Coweta County late yesterday . No serious injuries , but a frightening experience for a number of people trapped by the storm , including 30 children at a birthday party . Rescuers had to fight their way through blocked roads just to get to them . In Washington , investigators trying to get the metro back on track after a series of accidents . The latest incident last night . A train jumping the tracks , slamming into a tunnel wall . A hundred and fifty hurt -- excuse me , 150 aboard , 20 hurt . Three workers were killed in accidents in the D.C. metro last year . Homeland security at the Port of Miami reporting all secure today . Three men still in custody this morning , though . Authorities shut down a section of the port after the trio tried to drive an 18- wheeler in , apparently without the correct paperwork . The men , two Iraqis and a Lebanese national , are legal U.S. residents , and their cargo did check out after all . Apparently , it was all a miscommunication fueled by a language barrier . The end of an era for air travelers this morning . The last DC-10 in a U.S. airline fleet to make its final landing with passengers aboard . Northwest Airlines Flight 98 from Honolulu to land in Minneapolis in about 20 minutes . Northwest first started flying DC-10s in 1972 . They 've carried more than 125 million passengers for the airline . McDonnell Douglas stopped building the wide bodies in 1998 -- Soledad . More now on that tornado you were just talking about a moment ago , Miles . It happened in Moreland , Georgia , which is outside of Atlanta . CNN 's Gary Tuchman is live for us at the scene this morning . Good morning , Gary . Soledad , good morning you to . And not such a good morning here , however . You 'll have to excuse the people of Coweta County , Georgia , about 40 miles south of Atlanta , if they feel they 're being targeted unfairly , because it appears that over the last three days they 've been hit by two tornadoes . And this is January . Usually in January you 're talking about snow or ice , even though it 's the South , but two tornadoes have hit this area because of the unusual weather that 's been afflicting much of the East Coast , the warm springtime-type weather . But you see this gas station , this BP station . You had a canopy destroyed , you had the convenient store destroyed . They 'll be closed for much of the day . You have in this area where we are -- once again , it 's about 45 minutes south of the city of Atlanta , Georgia -- up to 20 homes that have been heavily damaged , hundreds of trees that are down , and lots of lucky people , because there were fears yesterday from the fire chief when he heard that these winds came through and these trees were down , these homes were damaged , that people might be injured or killed . There have been no deaths , no serious injuries . But many people were trapped , including one 14-year-old who was in the bathtub .

We will tell you about it coming up after the break . Hello everyone . I 'm Kyra Phillips in the CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta . And I 'm Don Lemon . December 21st , 1970 , a day that will live in pop culture infamy and we 've got the story from the man who was there . If you do n't stick around for this , you ai n't nothing but a hound dog . You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM Well , we start with this . A new front in America 's war on terror or in al Qaeda 's jihad . Somalia may be both . You just want proof of that , listen to the latest terror tapes our senior editor of Arab Affairs has for us . Octavia Nasr joins us now . Airstrikes over the weekend and now these tapes . What are they saying ? You know , the intelligence community of course is not surprised -- this makes perfect sense . Of course , as our Barbara Starr has been reporting all day , information saying that U.S. intelligence with African intelligence have led to belief that target was , indeed , a place where al Qaeda members have been meeting . But all we needed to do is really go back to the tapes from al Qaeda leader , Osama bin Laden , back in June of 2006 , and also a message from Ayman al-Zawahiri , the number two man in al Qaeda , which was posted on the internet only a week ago at the beginning of this year .
BN	Ethiopian troops cross the border . U.S. air strikes follow . Why the sudden heat on Somalia ? We 'll talk with a man who has been there . You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. But first , from briefing rooms and war rooms , straight to your living room , we already heard plenty about President Bush 's new plan for Iraq which he unveils tonight . But he 'll also talk about what went wrong in the old plans , including too few Iraqi and U.S. troops , and flawed rules of engagement . Now , here 's what we know about the new strategy . U.S. sources say President Bush wants to send more than 21,000 extra troops to Iraq . Most of them to Baghdad , others to Anbar province , the heart of the Sunni insurgency . The goal is to hand control of Iraq to Iraqi troops by November , but U.S. troops would stay as backup . The plan also calls for a billion dollars in new economic aid earmarked for jobs . We 're at home , at work , at rest , at play , but we 're also at war . It 's hard for many Americans to keep that in mind . For others , though , it 's much easier . CNN 's Jill Dougherty reports . Oh , look at the play by number 34 Dawn Halfaker on the fly making a very athletic play . Back in her college days at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , Dawn Halfaker , top-scoring basketball player , thought of sacrifice as a theory . Now it 's a reality , every time she tries to open a bottle . When she was 24 , serving in Iraq , a grenade blew off her right arm . Dawn does n't look back much . She knows that in today 's America , in spite of an almost four-year war , life goes on . I also think that there is a part of America that , you know , maybe does n't understand what this is about and , really , because it does n't affect them . It does n't affect their daily lives . You know , there 's -- and that 's understandable , in a sense . This war is inconvenient to them in the sense that , you know , they have to hear about it on the news . But , you know , they can avoid it if they want to . Malls , like this one in the suburbs of Washington , D.C. , are still filled with shoppers . The war is taking no immediate economic toll , and yet it ripples through the life of many here , people like 19-year-old Tamar Aghkekian , a shop clerk who wears a bracelet with the ring her high school friend gave her when he finished boot camp . He 's now in Iraq . She thinks about him and the war even as she deals with customers . I mean , I think some people probably do block it out of their mind , because I guess they do n't want to think about all the people that 's dying . Shirley Grant ( ph ) lived through World War II , the rationing , coupons to buy gas , the sacrifice . This war , she says , is different . Everybody was willing to cooperate . This time , all you have in your mind is , let 's get out of there . It 's terrible . Everybody has been killed . It 's a disgrace .
BN	Yes . The political piece , it is composed of the following elements : the national oil law , which is the remarkable law in that it does not take a sectarian cast ; a new de-ba'athification policy which already has allowed the -- a number of officers to return to the armed forces and pensions to be paid , and there will be further effort on that ; a commitment to provincial elections , which the Sunnis feel will be important to writing the disproportionate -- disproportionately low share of their representation in provincial councils because they boycotted the elections early on . These are the elements of a national reconciliation plan . And I do n't think , Senator , it can be imposed from the outside . I do think the Iraqis themselves ... Listening now to more from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . And these are the hearings on the administration 's plan for Iraq . Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice responding at the moment to Senator John Kerry and some questions that he had . We will continue to monitor that for you . The Iraq Study Group , they advised the White House . And now that the president has decided on a strategy , a member of the panel visits the NEWSROOM. That 's coming up . And promises , promises . The president 's plan depends on Iraqi action . Can the struggling government make it work ? We will talk with Iraq 's top diplomat in the U.S. ahead in the NEWSROOM. Looking for hope in embryonic stem cells . I believe I 'll walk again . I believe this very firmly . More federal money for stem cell research , it 's on the House agenda today . Details in the NEWSROOM. And this news just in to us here at CNN. We have learned the Democrats have chosen Denver , the Mile High City , for the site of their 2008 Democratic convention . And once again , the Mile High City , Denver , Colorado , will be the spot for the 2008 Democratic convention . We 'll bring more information to you if something else should develop on that . So now we know . Meanwhile , President Bush spells out the new strategy for Iraq . The administration says it is an Iraqi plan , and success depends on Iraq fulfilling its promises . Joining us from Washington to talk about just that , the Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. , Samir al Sumaidaie . Thank you , sir , for being with us . Thank you . Let 's go ahead and listen to a little bit of what the president said last night . He described the last two years as follows . The elections of 2005 were a stunning achievement . We thought that these elections would bring the Iraqis together , and that as we trained Iraqi security forces we could accomplish our mission with fewer American troops . But in 2006 , the opposite happened . The violence in Iraq , particularly in Baghdad , overwhelmed the political gains the Iraqis had made . Mr. Ambassador , tell us what you think happened in that one year , in your view . Well , we have learned a lot of lessons . The last year has been tough on the Americans and it has been even tougher , much tougher , on the Iraqis .
BN	There 's a lot of agents in town right now frothing at the mouth about the idea of , wow , he is in Hollywood now . Let 's book him for movies , let 's get a TV show . Beckham was an instant celebrity among American soccer fans when he visited in 2005 . This time he is after a whole different level of fame . Chris Lawrence , CNN, Los Angeles . Still to come , more troops for Iraq . The president 's war planners explaining to Congress how they 'll help . Combat Capitol Hill style in the NEWSROOM. The president is selling his Iraq plan , but it appears most Americans are n't buying it . We 're getting the first poll numbers on the new strategy this morning . Here 's our senior political analyst Bill Schneider . Good evening . Wednesday night , President Bush spoke dramatically about the high stakes in Iraq . It is the decisive , ideological struggle of our time . And his new plan for dealing with it . So I 've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq . The public 's response ? Two to one negative . In fact , half the public say they strongly oppose the troop buildup . Leading Democrats denounce the president 's proposal . The president 's plan moves the American commitment in Iraq in the wrong direction . Democratic voters are virtually united in their opposition . Eighty-eight percent oppose the buildup . And the president 's base ? Two-thirds of Republican voters support President Bush on Iraq . But we 're beginning to hear criticism from Republican politicians . I think this speech given last night by this president represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam . He speaks for the 30 percent of Republican voters who oppose Mr. Bush 's plan . Our troops will have a well-defined mission . The public does not agree . Only 35 percent believe President Bush has a clear plan for Iraq . That 's up a bit from the 25 percent who felt that way before he spoke . But 63 percent of Americans still do n't see a clear plan . Now , the poll we just reported is part of a new partnership . Today CNN is announcing the CNN Opinion Research Corporation Poll . We plan to bring you the most accurate , most insightful public opinion polling anywhere . A sweet and long , long flight for family . Embracing a future together after a very long adoption struggle . Details from reporter reporter Jeanne Macken ( ph ) of CNN affiliate WMUR , Manchester , New Hampshire . Judy Keller flips through a family photo album while she waited inside a Manchester courtroom for a judge to make her family official . Inside that album , 14 years of memories , starting from the moment Judy and her husband , John , tried to adopt Katy in Virginia . Her birth mother was a prison inmate , and months after she handed over Katy in the hospital , she changed her mind . Katy was raised by the Kellers during years of legal arguments . They insisted race should not be an issue , and they would be the best parents for Katy . This year , the birth mother , who is still an inmate , agreed to the adoption . Katy signed the adoption papers , and for the first time , Judy held Katy in her arms as her legally adopted daughter .
BN	But Armstrong and the American Cancer Society do n't agree , saying funding for next year has been cut 30 percent because cancer is n't sexy . When you come along and you talk about cancer and talk about funding , it 's not , for lack of a better word , it 's not sexy anymore . But , you know , we can all remember the frenzy around the bird flu . We can all remember the frenzy around SARS. People were freaking out . But what we need now is we need people to re-engage in the fight against cancer . And that means an Armstrong-led grassroots effort at making the Feds re-engage , like this one on Capitol Hill back in September . But again those critics , who say celebrity clout sometimes clouds the issue , directing money where it does n't deserve to go . Take a look . According to the National Institutes of Health , $ 5.6 billion federal goes toward cancer research . That compares to $ 2.3 billion for cardiovascular disease , which kills twice as many people in this country , and $ 1.1 million for diabetes , a growing health care crisis in the country . And as for HIV-AIDS research , that clocks in at $ 2.9 billion . We are calling for a redistribution of some of that 10 percent that now goes to HIV to other diseases . But , Wolf , the American Cancer Society says this is n't a contest and there certainly is no denying this -- 1.3 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer every year . And we know many of them . Thank you very much , Carol , for that . So can the Tour de France champion win this uphill race and get the federal government to increase cancer funding ? And joining us now is Lance Armstrong . Lance , thanks very much for coming in . Thanks for what you 're doing . Absolutely . Thanks for having me , Wolf . You wrote a piece on CNN.com this week . It 's got an incredible number of hits . Among other things what you said is this . " What are we going to do to effectively fight cancer ? Millions of Americans with cancer are asking , ' I 'm not known for my patience when it comes to cancer , I hope you are n't , either . '" What 's going on ? Tell us what your new initiative is all about . Well , it 's -- you know , it 's really a 10-year initiative for me . I mean , I was diagnosed more than 10 years ago . And , you know , looking back to that day , if you just said to me at the time , you know , what 's cancer going to look like 10 years from now ? I probably would n't have guessed that it looks the way it does today . You know , having said that , we 've had success stories . I mean , I 'm obviously sitting here , came back to win seven tours . You know , there 's 10 million cancer survivors in this country . But the fact of the matter is that we lose 600,000 American lives every year to cancer , and so , you know , that is a huge number . And if that happened on one single day in an act of terrorism , this country would go absolutely crazy .
BN	And as I mentioned , Ashley 's story and her parents ' decision have created a firestorm of e-mails , blog entries , and editorials . Medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen has been tracking the emotional Internet traffic -- Elizabeth . Thanks , Sanjay . It seems like everyone on the Internet these days has an opinion about what Ashley 's parents did to their daughter . Now , a lot of the blogging has been done from other parents with disabled children . For example , a blogger who calls herself "nuf said " ' wrote , " Ashley 's parents need to be charged with child abuse . Her physicians need to be locked up for life for mutilation . I am just revolted . " Now there have also been positive comments . For example , Christina writes on the CNN.com Web site , " We want our children to be happy . And in the face of such a heartbreaking disability , why would n't we do everything in our power to obtain that happiness ? " Now this story lives on the Internet . It 's the only place where Ashley 's parents communicate with the public . And I 'm sure that we 're going to see even more opinions come out in the days and weeks to come . Sanjay ? I bet you 're right . That sounds like it would be true . Thanks , Elizabeth . Whether in you 're 40s and worried about your parents , or you 're in your 60s and beyond worried about senior moments , a new study offers some hope . Researchers at Columbia University found folate , or folic acid , may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer 's Disease . Very interesting . Scientists discovered that all the people they researched , those who had very little folate in their diet had the highest risk of Alzheimer 's , while those who consumed adequate amounts through diet or supplements had the lowest risk . Now you may be asking yourself , what is an adequate amount ? Well , a cup of frozen spinach would work or two cups of peas or a three ounce piece of liver . Each of those would satisfy your folate needs for the day and these researchers believe lower your risk of developing the memory-robbing disease . Over the next few decades , the number of Alzheimer 's cases is going to explode . It 's a fact . Experts predict a quadrupling , four times in the number of people with the disease . What many people do n't realize is there 's no definitive diagnosis for Alzheimer 's . Judy Fortin has that story . I was relieved , really , because there was a name to it . It was n't a good thing , but at least I knew that I was n't crazy . Fifty-year-old Kris Bakowski has early onset Alzheimer 's . Getting the diagnosis took almost nine months . Unfortunately , even for the typical form of Alzheimer 's disease that happens in older adults , half of the people in the United States who have Alzheimer 's disease go unrecognized by their physicians . Dr. Morris says specialists are 90 percent accurate in diagnosing the disease , but first must eliminate other illnesses and then ask a series of questions to determine extent of memory loss . It surprises many people that Alzheimer 's disease has no test . You ca n't do a blood test or a CAT scan or an MRI scan .

BN	As you look back on that one , what are your thoughts ? At the gall that he had . You know , I ca n't believe that he would , you know , be in the process of a crime and call the police and draw attention to himself . Bill , you have been , obviously , thinking about this a lot since this all broke . What -- what are the emotions that come to mind in a case like this , when you know a suspect that is linked something like this ? I guess sort of confusion and frustrations are the biggest ones . I mean , from what I understand , some of Shaw n 's friends in the area confronted him and actually said , " You look like Shawn Hornbeck , " and he sort of blew the whole thing off , and got away with it . And this apartment complex -- I own one building , but the buildings are close together . And there are a lot of people out , especially in warmer weather . And , apparently , this kid was in plain sight -- Michael , you know , obviously , not doing anything much to hide . In fact , you could see right into the back bedroom driving by some nights . It 's just kind of frustration over if I could have or should have done anything differently . And Michael Devlin is awaiting arraignment on one count of first-degree kidnapping .

Well Utah state lawmakers are working even though today is a state and federal holiday honoring Dr. King . They say the state constitution requires them to begin their annual session on the third Monday in January . The president of the state Senate says they 're honoring King by meeting on his holiday with speakers addressing his legacy . But the head of the Salt Lake City NAACP says that lawmakers should be embarrassed . Let 's take you out live now to St . Petersburg , Florida . This is how they 're celebrating the King day . Hundreds of people , you can see a marching band there in St . Petersburg , Florida . The weather could not be nicer . They 're celebrating with a parade and honoring Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. Well if MLK Jr. had stuck to his script at the Lincoln Memorial and the March on Washington , it still would have been a speech for the ages . But it would not have been forever known as the " I Have a Dream " speech . Dr. King 's inner circle had prepared , worked , and reworked , agonized over a different speech .

CNN 's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has this report now from his series , " Saving your Life . " Mike Sutton was an energetic basketball coach with Tennessee Tech when his health took a stunning turn for the worse . My hands and feet ached and I was really tired , and collapsed in the parking lot , fell down on my suitcase . With no warning , Sutton was struck with Guillain-Barre Syndrome or GBS. GBS causes the body 's immune system to mistakenly attack and destroy the insulation protecting the nerves in your body . So in just a matter of days , Mike was paralyzed . He could barely move a muscle . The thumb and index finger I could move just ever so slightly . He needed a tracheotomy to breathe . He could n't talk . He could just blink . You have no way to communicate , and that 's probably the most frustrating thing , is you have no way to tell people if there 's pain . That was almost two years ago . Today , coach Sutton is making a slow , and what many consider , an unbelievable comeback . Talk your way through , it talk your way through it . Talk , Francis , talk Francis . Sutton is helped a specially designed wheelchair , a walker , and support from his staff , as well as lots of hard work . Last year , my hands were limp like this .

BN	Ali , good morning . How good is good ? Good is really good . We 're almost at 50 bucks a barrel . I mean , you remember , we talked about this many times . My big barrel of oil , and it was up to $ 78 a barrel . A year and a half now , and this is partially because of the warm weather in the United States and in other parts of the world . But the United States obviously is the single biggest consumer of oil in the world . So , oil down to 50 bucks a barrel . How does that translate to gas ? Well , first of all , oil has dropped in the last month , let 's say , from about $ 64 to $ 51 , about a $ 13 drop . Gas has dropped in the last month from about $ 2.30 a gallon to about $ 2.22 a gallon . So that drop is n't complete if you believe that gas goes down with oil . Yes . But , you know , people we 've talked to said that the next 10 days or two weeks , expect a further drop in the price of gas . And , you know , we were up on one of the sites , gasbuddy .com . I counted 16 cities where you can get a gallon of gas , self-serve regular , for less than two bucks right now . Get out of here . Really ? Hey , but I have to ask you -- let 's go back to a barrel now of crude . Yes . What happens ? You 've seen the weather maps here . We 're locked in kind of a deep freeze around the country . Yes . What happens if we get a spike in demand for home heating oil ? What happens to the price of that barrel ? I mean , here 's the thing . There 's two aspects to his . One is how much oil we actually buy and use , and the other is how much the traders think we 're going to buy and use . And , you know , the minute it gets cold , they start thinking , oh my god , it 's going to be a deep freeze , the price of oil might go up . But we were waiting for OPEC to see what OPEC is going to say about $ 50 a barrel . Right . And OPEC has said they 've got a cut scheduled for February 1st , half a million barrels a day , a production cut . They do n't seed a need for any more cuts in oil . So that has sort of stabilized it . But you 're right , it 's cold now and we 're going to start using our heating oil . The Northeast of the United States uses heating oil very heavily . So we 'll have to see where this goes . But for the time being , you might as well enjoy the price . You might as well enjoy it . Hey , how about this ? So , the national average , $ 2.22 for a gallon of gas . Might we soon see the return of the SUV ? Yes . Or am I getting away ahead of myself here ? You 'll probably see -- no , Tony , you do n't . That 's the funny thing about the American shopper . Nobody ever waits . I bet you they 're selling today .
BN	Thank you . And coming up , how vulnerable is the United States to cyber terrorism ? I 'll ask the former national counter-terrorism official and best- selling author , Richard Clark . He 's standing by live . Plus , President Bush facing growing pressure to act on global warming . We 're going to show you why there 's speculation he may be about to change his position . Stay with us . You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM. To our viewers , you 're in THE SITUATION ROOM , where new pictures and information are arriving all the time . Happening now , growing moves on Capitol Hill to influence the war in Iraq . Senator Hillary Clinton planning a bill to cap U.S. troop levels while a key Republican senator joins two Democrats in unveiling a resolution against the president 's plan to send more troops in . Also , a controlled burn now underway south of Louisville , Kentucky . It 's an effort to burn off 90,000 gallons of hazardous chemicals remaining in train cars that derailed yesterday . The operation expected to last up to 18 hours and keep hundreds of people from returning home . And a new system to compare airline passenger names with terror watch lists now set to debut next year . The so-called Secure Flight System will put the burden on the government instead of the airlines . It was supposed to take effect in 2005 , but has been delayed by privacy concerns . I 'm Wolf Blitzer . You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM. President Bush may feel like he 's behind barricades over at the White House . Facing a growing backlash over his Iraq troop build-up proposal , he is now backtracking on his domestic surveillance program , a key element of his anti-terror policy . Let 's go live to our White House correspondent , Ed Henry -- Ed . Let 's go live to our White House correspondent , Ed Henry -- Ed . Wolf , these are clear signs that this president , who for five years had a free hand to conduct the war on terror , is now dealing with a much different political reality . A sharp reversal for President Bush on the issue of warrantless wiretapping , even though press secretary Tony Snow tried to portray it as a situation where the Justice Department has no problem with an independent court monitoring the administration 's controversial domestic spying . The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has put together its guidelines and its rules , and those have met administration concerns about speed and agility A far cry from what the president has repeatedly asserted , that he needed special powers because the 1978 FISA law was outdated . And I looked . I said , " Look , is it possible to conduct this program under the old law ? " And people said , " It does n't work in order to be able to do the job we expect us to do . " Democrats who have long charged the president 's terrorist surveillance program may have been illegal and unconstitutional declared it was about time the president came around . They do n't have to follow the law . They can step outside the law . They do n't have to follow the checks and balances . But I 'd say all Americans , no matter what your political leans may be , all Americans ought to ask , why are they doing this ?
BN	Absolutely . . to stay away from Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie and places like Hyde . It is not like she could expect to show up there and get a little bottle of water and be satisfied with that , if I understand you . That is correct . And addicts and alcoholics very often do that to sort of -- they think they are testing themselves . But in fact they are just moving closer to a relapse at that point . God , that` s got to be difficult , especially when it` s all ... It is tough . But I mean , she needs to be sort of supported and congratulated for taking care of herself . But it may -- you know , this may not be the end of the story . There may be more treatment . And you`ve got to understand something , you know , addiction is a chronic illness . It is not an acute illness that resolves like a pneumonia . It` s an illness like diabetes or asthma . And we do n` t look at diabetes and say , gee , that person` s blood sugar went out of control , diabetic treatment does n` t work . We say , look , it needs further treatment , it needs further encouragement . It needs further intervention . And the same is true with addiction . Even people who are diligently involved in recovery can have slips and they go back and get , let` s say , tuned up , so to speak . But again , you know , it` s funny how I heard a lot of mudslinging towards rehab earlier in the program tonight . And it really is a very serious issue . It` s a medical illness . These young women are at risk . Their lives are in danger by this condition . And if they do n` t take this seriously , the outcomes will not be good . Yes , our publicist that we spoke with , Howard Bragman , said when he` s directing one of his clients toward rehab , it certainly is for very serious reasons . Quickly , Dr. Drew , I know it may be difficult to assess , but if Lindsay were your patient , what would your recommendation be for her based on what you know of her situation ? Well , not knowing exactly what she was doing , basically , what we do is we bring someone in for an assessment , have a medical assessment , a psychiatric assessment , hook up a psychologist , have her dive deeply into the 12-step process with her peers , and then hold her out of her work environment from at least three to six months . Yes . That seems like a really important component . And as I have said before , whatever she is going through , we wish her the best . Dr. Drew Pinsky , I thank you for joining us , as always . Thank you . That leads us to our SHOWBIZ TONIGHT question of the day . Here is what we want to know . Lindsay Lohan in rehab , do you think it will work ?

BN	Let 's begin this morning with a developing story . The defense secretary , Robert Gates , making an unannounced stop at Iraq overnight . Gates is in Tallil now , in southern Iraq , meeting with U.S. commanders and coalition troop leader . The stopover comes as Gates makes some surprising comments on Iran and its influence on the war in Iraq . Here 's CNN 's Pentagon correspondent , Barbara Starr . On his first tour of the Persian Gulf as Defense Secretary , Robert Gates admitted that as long as things are so difficult for U.S. troops in Iraq , the hard-line regime in Iran has the upper hand , at least for now . I think that our difficulties have given them a tactical opportunity in the short term . Gates once favored talking to Iran . Now he 's making clear that would n't work either , leaving the U.S. little leverage to stop Iran 's nuclear program or its support for Shia militias in Iraq . Frankly , right at this moment there 's really nothing the Iranians want from us . And so in any negotiation right now , we would be the supplicant . And there 's new evidence that Iran is behind attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq . CNN has learned that in a series of recent raids in Iraq , U.S. troops have seized IEDs designed to penetrate U.S.-armored vehicles , a hallmark of Iranian weapons technology . Also seized were other weapons with Iranian manufacturing stamps , documents showing shipping addresses tied to Iran , and even a map showing Shia and Sunni areas of Iraq . The U.S. is still holding 13 people detained in those raids , trying to determine just how involved Iran is in attacks against U.S. troops . President Bush has vowed to try and stop Iran 's influence , but his new defense secretary is suggesting that may be a very difficult proposition . Barbara Starr , CNN, the Pentagon . And there are conflicting reports this morning about a deal on North Korea 's nuclear weapons plan . North Korea says it reached an agreement with the U.S. this weak during talks in Berlin . America 's top nuclear envoy , though , Christopher Hill , says he 's not so sure about that . He says he sees positive signs pointing to progress in the next round of meetings . Wild weather making news again this morning all around the world . Snow , ice , freezing rain bearing down on the Southwest U.S. as we speak . Let 's begin with Reggie Aqui in Krebs , Oklahoma . Reggie , good morning . Well , Miles , as you know , this whole section of the country has been hit pretty hard over the last week . But this particular part of southeast Oklahoma has been sort of like a weather punching bag . They just get hit over and over again , and they 're getting ready for another storm tonight . At one point , you could probably walk right through here to get to the front door of this person 's house . Now it 's completely blocked by all this ice . You see these trees that have fallen down ? Well , this ice is a big problem , of course , when it comes to electricity . And you can see when you look up there that a week after this area was hit with the first round of storms , there are still icicles hanging from power lines .
BN	And now that Hillary Clinton has announced that she 's running for president , how do New Yorkers feel about it ? She is their senator . Reaction from her home state in a bit . I 'm Elaine Quijano live at the White House . CNN has learned that President Bush plans to unveil soon a proposal for a new tax deduction for health care . What might that mean for you and what are critics saying about the idea ? I 'll have details , coming up . Thanks so much , Elaine . Meanwhile , the first -- the confluence of crime fighting and YouTube ? New York City says it will soon upgrade its 911 system so callers can send pictures from their cell phone cameras to police . Here 's CNN Internet reporter Abbi Tatton . Mayor Michael Bloomberg calls it a revolutionary innovation in crime fighting -- 911 meets YouTube . Equipping 911 call centers to receive digital images and videos New Yorkers send from their cell phones and computers -- something no other city in the world is doing . New York officials hope sending in images will quickly become standard practice . Though this plan may be a first , police in many cities have been expanding their use of the Internet . Last December in Hamilton , Ontario , a man was arrested after police investigating a murder posted surveillance video on YouTube . A video recently posted online of a beating by school girls led to attempted assault charges . And in New York City , police used photos of this subway flasher , posted on the Internet , to make an arrest . But when it comes to reporting incidents as they happen , until now , it 's mainly been news organizations soliciting eyewitness images . When Yankees ' pitcher Cory Lidle 's plane crashed into a Manhattan building last fall , New Yorkers instantly sent images from the crash site to CNN. Now , New York City police are hoping to tap into the same technology to help 911 operators prioritize emergencies . New York City officials do n't think the program will be too costly , as the technology is already in place . New Yorkers should be able to start using the program in the next two years . Abbi Tatton , CNN, Washington . This is CNN breaking news . It 's always tough news to report something like this . We told you earlier about 13 soldiers , U.S. soldiers , that lost their lives when a helicopter went down . Well , we just received more information . This is about five more U.S. soldiers that have , sadly enough , lost their lives , as well . The five U.S. soldiers were killed , three were wounded , while trying to repel an attack . It happened at something called the PJCC. That 's a provincial joint coordination center , in Karbala . Now , what they were doing there is they were meeting , trying to figure out a way -- in fact , I 'll give you one of the quotes that 's coming from military officials . They say a meeting was taking place at the time of the attack to ensure the security of Shiite pilgrims who are participating in one of the commemorations there . It 's called the Ashura commemoration .
BN	Jerry White is suspected of kidnapping his four children and their mother several hours after breaking into her house , allegedly . He 's also suspected of critically wounding a man in the house . The children are between the ages of 9 the years and 16 months old . Well , they are keeping an eye out for more snow in Texas . Amarillo got more than eight inches last night , keeping state and city crews working around the clock to help clear the roads there . And so now to the race for the White House . The swelling ranks of Democratic hopefuls expanded again today . To tell us about the latest scramble into the race , CNN 's Bob Franken in Manchester , New Hampshire , where some form exploratory committees and others do n't . Well , eventually just about all of them do . It becomes the pre-announcement announcement that an exploratory committee is going to be formed . And right now you are probably asking yourself , so what is an exploratory committee ? You were , were n't you ? Yes . You read my mind . Yes . The exploratory committee is to do just that , to explore -- at least theoretically -- to explore the potential for a presidential candidacy . But what it also is , is it 's a fund-raising mechanism . So you decide whether the exploratory committee is actually to explore or to raise money . But it becomes the precursor to a presidential candidacy . However , it does not bind the person to run , as evidenced by the fact that Evan Bayh pulled out -- Fredricka . But they do have to use that money perhaps maybe if they decide not to be a presidential candidate . They do have to use it for some other kind of campaign , right ? Right . There are those kinds of restrictions . They ca n't just pocket the money . But , of course , the politician who intends to stay in politics always needs the mother 's milk of money . If the candidate does decide to run , then the money raised for the exploratory committee can be turned over to the campaign . All right . Well , let 's talk about one of the latest candidates , Governor Bill Richardson . What an incredible resume . I mean , this man has incredible world diplomacy experience . He 's also got domestic policy experience . But at the same time , he 's competing with a few other candidates who are popular for other reasons . Namely , because they are simply popular and they have got the name recognition . What 's he up against ? Well , name recognition , of course , is massively important . But the thing to remember is that it is a full year -- in fact , almost to the day -- a full year before the primary here . And there is an awful lot of time for the name recognition to work for or against the candidate . There is an awful lot of time for some candidate somehow who is not as well known to capture the imagination of voters . So name recognition is important now . But it is not the be all , end all at this point in the campaign . All right . Bob Fraken , thanks so much , from Manchester , New Hampshire .
BN	And what 's it like to run against Hillary Rodham Clinton ? She 's a very disciplined campaigner . She 's a very cautious campaigner . She 'll be well briefed . Tips for current political rivals from a past opponent . That 's coming up in THE NEWSROOM. Michael Devlin speaks -- the man charged with kidnapping two Missouri teens now tells snippets of his story . CNN 's Rick Sanchez has more . The accused kidnapper talked to the " New York Post " in two 15-minute interviews given from the Franklin County Jail . Michael Devlin admitted to the " Post " that he has n't talked to his parents yet , saying , " It 's much easier talking to a stranger about these things than your own parents . " Devlin , who comes from a large family , told the paper the only visitors he 's had in jail were his attorneys . He also told the reporter that he became lonely and withdrawn in 2002 when he was diagnosed with diabetes . When talking about the past four years , the amount of time that Shawn Hornbeck was missing , Devlin told the " Post , " and we quote , " I guess I was relatively happy . " The newspaper reports when asked if he was attracted to women , Devlin answered , " I ca n't talk about that because it has to do with the case . " Last week , Sean Hornbeck 's parents told Oprah they thought their son was sexual abused during his captivity . Devlin has pleaded not guilty to one charge of felony kidnapping in regards to Ben Ownby and he is expected to be arraigned on kidnapping charges in the case of Shawn Hornbeck as well . Rick Sanchez , CNN, Atlanta . Michael Devlin 's attorneys are taking exception with the " New York Post " interview , saying their reporter deceived their client . They 're expected to file a motion today to have Devlin moved to another facility . I think the media is always going to try and do their job . And their job is to try and gain access to people of interest , people that -- and he 's obviously an interesting character . I mean nobody really knows anything about him . Nevertheless , I think it 's the jail 's fault . There are several inaccuracies and they are grave inaccuracies . And we are , of course , you know , worried that things of an inflammatory nature will have an impact on people who are -- on how people view this case and potential jury people . Ambulances rushing in for another round of wounded . Insurgents pulling off a sneak attack against American G.I.s . Iraq 's latest in THE NEWSROOM. It is getting crowded out there -- 17 so far eyeing the Oval Office exactly a year before New Hampshire . We 're looking for elbow room here in THE NEWSROOM. And hold on -- it is -- hang in there -- it 's treacherous out there . More miserable winter weather to tell you about in THE NEWSROOM. We 're right back . Let 's get the business day started , what do you say ? Ring-ring , ring the bell . Come on , come on , Jeff Turner . There you go , Jeff Turner ringing the bell to get the business day going , from Spirit Aerosystems . Well , thank you , for the question about Spirit Aerosystems , Heidi .
BN	How concerned are you with the recent spike in violence in New Orleans ? Well , we are very concerned . But as we speak , we have 360 troops on the ground . I have 300 members of the National Guard and 60 state police who are working the city , who are working under the authority and the direction of the chief of police in New Orleans . We are watching that situation very carefully . We 're encouraging them . We 're picking up the pieces because they -- they lost a significant number of their force . Yes . We are meeting with them and trying to get that force strength back up . And they 're doing recruiting now and we 're trying to back that up . And difficult to diversify your economy , to bring jobs to the region , companies to the region , if this city gets this tag , this label as being a place where violent crime happens . Well , every large city has its own measure of violent crime . But the citizens of New Orleans have -- have just put their foot down and say they want it stopped . And I think that 's a very good sign , when you 've got -- when you have citizen involvement . We 're going to help the legal and the law enforcement system get back on its footing . There were a lot of problems with the jails not being completed and the courtrooms being ruined by the storms . But we 're trying to tackle it from every single angle . Less than half of New Orleans ' pre-storm population of 454,000 has returned . Are you concerned that your city , your big city -- I mean there are other big cities , obviously , in Louisiana -- but are you concerned that New Orleans is going to become a forgotten , a lost city ? Well , I think as we get the housing back up , we 're going to see people coming back every day . Right now , every single day brings 50 to 100 new students enrolling in the school systems in New Orleans . So we see there is an in migration trend . And as people can find housing , they are coming home . Our people basically are homesick . And we 're working very hard to be able to get their homes back up and enable them to come home where they want to be . Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco with us this morning . Great to see you , Governor . Congratulations on a great season for your Saints . Thank you . We are very proud of the Saints . Hoo-dad ! Hoo-dad ! Thank you .

BN	We see the president and Laura Bush walking out right now . The president and the first lady will be getting in that presidential limo . They 'll be making the short drive down Pennsylvania Avenue , Paula , from the White House up to Capitol Hill . He 's been rehearsing , he 's been practicing . He 's been going through the speech for days now , and clearly he seems ready . We interrupted Ed with -- we wanted to show our viewers the president and the first lady leaving the White House , Ed , right behind you . That 's right , he 's heading over . You know , it 's probably going to take less than 10 minutes . A short drive , of course . As I was noting , health care one of the big focuses of this speech . What the president wants that to do is to cut into the 46 million people who do not have health insurance is to make health benefits a standard tax deduction . He thinks that will encourage more people actually buy into the system , get their own health insurance . And what he 's going to say tonight , in part is : " In all we do , we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies , but by patients and their doctors . " Now , Democrats , though , are jumping on this even before this speech is delivered , because they say that by making it a tax deduction , this also makes health benefits taxable income and it 's going to wind up being a tax increase on many Americans -- Wolf . All right , thanks , Ed . Ed , stand by . We 're going to get back to you . The president goes into tonight 's speech facing some very daunting poll numbers . Our CNN/" USA Today "/Gallup Poll and CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll -- that 's a mouthful -- show the president with a 34 percent approval rating right now . And you can see the steady decline over the past six Januarys , from a high of 84 percent . That was back in 2002 . And it 's gone down steadily ever since , as we can see . Let 's bring in our senior political analyst , Bill Schneider -- historically , Bill , as we take a look at these numbers , the president 's got a major hurdle in front of him . He certainly does . That 34 percent figure where he is right now , that is not only the lowest for President Bush , it 's the lowest for any president in at least the last 50 years , going into the next to the last year of his presidency . If a president 's poll ratings go down like that , he -- it may not make much difference to him He does n't have to face the voters again . He ca n't run again . But he needs allies . And he loses clout with ratings like that , because even the members of his own party start moving away from him , start abandoning his policies . He 's seeing that happening right now with the Republicans on the Iraq War . On to some more numbers now . We 're going to look at another CNN/Opinion Research Corporation showing -- poll showing 64 percent favor a resolution opposing a troop build-up in Iraq . The bill -- the president has also said he knows that adding troops wo n't be popular .
BN	As you face the political scene here over the next year or so , Reverend James Dobson , conservative evangelical , Focus on the Family group , said in a radio interview just the other day that he could not support you under any circumstances . To what extent , as you face the primaries , where conservative voters have a lot of sway , to what extent is this a political problem for you ? I do n't know , but I have never had a conversation with Dr. Dobson . He 's entitled to his opinion . It 's a free country and I 'm not going to worry about it . You 're not worried about it ? No. And concern on the conservative side of the party ? Well , you know , you 're always a little -- wonder why someone you never had a conversation with attacks you , but , hey , we 'll move on . We 're doing fine . All right . Thank you . Senator John McCain , thanks for your time this morning . Thanks , Miles . Soledad . Coming up this morning , Democratic reaction to last night 's speech . New Mexico governor and presidential hopeful Bill Richardson will join us live . We 'll get his take on the State of the Union . Plus , a major victory for thousands of homeowners hit hard by Hurricane Katrina . We 'll explain what they got when we mind your business straight ahead . Stay with us . Some Katrina victims are going to finally be getting the money from their insurance company . It is 25 minutes past the hour . Carrie Lee is " Minding Your Business " this morning . Good morning . Thank you , Soledad . Big story here for State Farm Insurance . The company has agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement of Hurricane Katrina lawsuits in the state of Mississippi . Now , breaking this down , the company 's going to pay $ 80 million to 640 policyholders who have sued the company for refusing to cover damage , and then also , they could pay money to thousands of Mississippi policyholders , up to $ 35,000 , whose claims were denied , but they did n't sue the company . Now those cases are going to be reopened . Of course , State Farm has argued all along that it was water , not wind , that caused damage to people 's homes , and that it does not cover for flood damage . But bottom line , this settlement resolves a civil lawsuit that Mississippi 's attorney general has filed . It also ends a criminal investigation . And Soledad , this is Mississippi-wide . No other states apply . So it could potentially set a precedent for other states , as well as for other insurers . But a lot of money is going to be paid here , for sure . About time for many people who have been waiting a long , long time for that cash . Exactly , yes . So these are all going to be put in writing within 18 business days and then people can decide whether they want to accept or reject the offers . Carrie Lee , thank you very much . Sure . We 're going to meet a man who wants to take President Bush 's place at the White House come 2008 . Up next , New Mexico 's Democratic governor , Bill Richardson , will join us live with his reaction to last night 's State of the Union Address .
BN	They sure do . Let 's talk about what 's happening in America this morning . In California , Norovirus is striking again . This time it 's on the Queen Elizabeth 2 , which is now docked in San Francisco . The QE2 was on a global cruise when more than 300 of the 1,600 passengers on board and some members of the crew , too , came down with the stomach virus . That virus is highly contagious . Well , it spread right through all those passengers . Right now the Centers for Disease Control says only four passengers are still sick . At the St . Louis Auto Show , a big rewards for that 15-year-old boy whose tip helped police find the two missing boys in Missouri . Mitchell Hults . Look at this . Here 's why he has a big smile on his face today . He is the new owner of a new Dodge Ram pickup . That 's courtesy of DaimlerChrysler . Hults , you 'll remember , provided that crucial tip that he noticed the white pickup near the spot where Ben Ownby was last seen . And it was that tip that eventually helped find both Ownby and Shawn Hornbeck . Might be a new millionaire in Missouri . Somebody is holding a Powerball ticket worth $ 254 million . Only one ticket matched all six numbers . There has not been a top winner in the multi-state Powerball game since last November . Tiger Woods , eat your heart out . Take a look at this . This is AJ the parakeet . Watch AJ playing golf . Yes , his owner spent months -- there you go . What a beautiful shot . Plays like Miles . No, I would miss it . Spent months training him on a miniature golf putting green . Oh , and he does basketball , too . Yes , he does . And gymnastics . And he can play dead apparently as well . That AJ. That 's that a triple threat , quadruple threat ? I think he is . Oh , I like that move there , too . All right . Very talented ( ph ) . That 's an owner with a lot of time on his hands . Yes , I should say . Not to sound like a broken record , but the Dow broke another record . Twenty-five minutes past the hour , Carrie Lee in for Ali Velshi . Good morning , Carrie . Good morning to you , Miles . That 's right , another record on the Dow , so good news here for the bulls closing at 12,621 points last night . And it 's looking like a slightly bullish start for this morning 's session as well with technology stocks leading the way thanks , in large part , to eBay . Last night the company blew past Wall Street estimates . Profits up 24 percent during the quarter . During the holiday season , over 81 million registered users exchanged over $ 14 billion worth of goods . So eBay shares gained 5 percent during the session yesterday ahead of the report and then added another 13 percent after hours . So that 's going to be a hot stock to watch today . Also , after 95 years , Crisco is going on a diet . The company 's shortening products will now have zero grams of transfat per serving . That 's well below the FDA guidelines . Of course , last month , New York City was the first city to ban transfats in its restaurants and fast food outlets . And , Miles , other cities are considering a similar measure .
BN	All right . We 'll keep tracking it , Fred . Thanks . Well , it 's that time of year again . Offices are buzzing with talk about the big game . That may be fun for you , but it could be bad for your employer . Susan Lisovicz joining us from the New York Stock Exchange to tell us about the Super Bowl slowdown . We 're at the half hour now , and we 're still following a developing story out of Arizona . This is what we can tell you so far . An Amber Alert has been issued in Maricopa , Arizona . This is what we know . A six-year-old girl has been abducted , authorities believe , by this man ; 26-year-old George Richard Horner . He 's a registered sex offender in Louisiana . He 's driving either a green or blue Nissan Pathfinder , it actually has Louisiana plates , PKL-399 . He 's a registered sex offender in Louisiana , but this story is unfolding in Maricopa , Arizona . A six-year-old girl believed to be abducted by him . We 're getting in these pictures from one of our affiliates , KPNX in Maricopa , Arizona . We believe this is the neighborhood where the six-year-old was abducted , possibly the home that she lives in . Police , right now , looking for him . Any information you have , you are asked to call authorities immediately . Time now to talk about the weather . Bitterly cold , dangerously cold across parts of the Northeast . A frightening sight outside Erie , Pennsylvania . Cars -- look at that -- and big rigs , even an ambulance in a twisted heap . The pile-up blamed on lake effect snow that blinded dozens of drivers , one of them was killed . Ten miles of I-90 was shut down for almost 15 hours . From Maine to Maryland , it is just plain raw . An arctic blast has brought the coldest temperatures of the season so far . The entire state of Massachusetts is under a wind chill advisory . How long will the arctic air hang around and where will it blow next ? Our Rob Marciano knows . Haifa Street , the main drag in a bad neighborhood , in the world 's most dangerous city . It 's a battlefield . But also a starting point in a combined effort to take back Baghdad . CNN 's Arwa Damon is there . Through the window of a crumbling theater , it could almost be a normal world outside . But this is Haifa Street in central Baghdad , where we ca n't venture out to talk to people , but snatch quick conversations in doorways . This man does n't want his face shown . " The street from here to here is safe , " he says . " But if you go down there , it 's very bad . " In one direction , kids play soccer in the street , apparently oblivious to the battleground close by . But down the street , Iraqi and U.S. forces try to dislodge insurgents . " We are happy to see the Iraqis and the Americans , but we ca n't be seen saying that , " he says . " They will slaughter us . " " They " are Sunni extremists , says Ali Hussein , a Shia who lives here . He calls them " The Others " . " It 's sort of a sectarian thing . But here we have Sunnis , too . But down there , they are different . "
BN	One reason ? No draft . Another reason , anti-war activities have a powerful ally they did n't have in the '60s . It 's not just the anti-war movement anymore . There 's now an anti-war public . SCHNEIDE Sixty-three percent of Americans oppose the president 's troop increase . The anti-war protest is aimed at Congress . You were elected with a mandate from the American people on Iraq . It 's time to fulfill it . Congress needs to stop the president 's escalation in Iraq . President Bush made this plea to Congress . Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq and I ask you to give it a chance to work . But when it comes to influencing Congress , an unpopular president is no match for an unhappy public . Members of Congress have to answer to the voters . So do candidates running for president . At some point , we 've got to step back and say what are our responsibilities in the face of obstinacy on the part of the White House ? One conservative Republican contender has already broken with President Bush on Iraq . It is difficult to understand why more U.S. troops would make a difference . So have two other potential Republican candidates . Sending more American troops into Baghdad is unnecessary to achieve the core victory over Al Qaeda In Iraq . Senator Chuck Hagel 's criticism has been full - throated . And I think all 100 senators ought to be on the line on this . What do you believe ? What are you willing to support ? What did you think ? Why are you elected ? If you wanted a safe job , go sell shoes . Only one presidential candidate , Democrat Dennis Kucinich , is scheduled to speak at this weekend 's anti-war march . Why are the candidates staying away ? Probably because they 're worried it could like the '60s . Jane Fonda is on the program . Bill Schneider , CNN, Washington . Senator John Kerry takes his anti-war campaign to the economic forum in Davos , Switzerland . The Massachusetts Democrat slammed the Bush administration 's foreign policy and told the economic forum the United States has become , quote , " a sort of international pariah" . I do n't care how many troops are put in . Iraq is not going to be pacified . Now , we are partly responsible . The absence of legitimate , significant diplomacy is a disgrace . ( INAUDIBLE ) by a secretary of state are not diplomacy . There should be a special envoy , maybe a joint , bipartisan special enjoy . Kerry criticized what he called the unfortunate habit of Americans to see the world through an American 's lens . Well , now we look at " Saving Your Life " and the role of race in cancer deaths . Our medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen examines why black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than white women . Patricia Hepburn walks the streets of Harlem looking to save lives . Hi , honey . At beauty shops , clothing stores , schools , Hepburn tells women the simple hard truth : cancer is not color-blind . For example , black women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are much more likely to die than white women , 32 percent more likely . White women , more likely to survive .

Rival Hamas and Fattah factions have been battling each other for several days now . About two dozen people have been killed since Friday . You know , once it was one of Baghdad 's most fashionable thoroughfares . Today , it is a bloody battleground . Haifa Street is located just outside the Green Zone , once home to Saddam Hussein 's government , later a base of operations to well-armed insurgents . Dozens of insurgents died in a major battle there this week . And CNN 's Arwa Damon is one of the CNN correspondents covering the battle for Haifa Street . She shows us the incredible dangers faced by the U.S. and Iraqi troops in this urban warfare . This is where the battle for Baghdad was fought , out of apartments and high-rise buildings that line this major Baghdad thoroughfare . Listen carefully as the U.S. troops spot an Iraqi insurgent in a nearby building . Right over here . See the corner of a building . Sunlight . They 're running between and that blue door . See there they go . The insurgents are so close , the Americans can see them without binoculars . There you go , there you go . That 's a money maker right there .

I heard that , um , when they found out like -- I guess after , like , they captured 'em and they found out she was a woman , she said that they treated her really well . They , you know , they did n't seem to bother her too much . But , um -- Well , they do kind of hold women in high regard over there , do n't they ? I -- ah , I -- I think so . I think -- well , I do n't know . Although they 're not allowed to do a lot . Do anything , yeah , exactly . I was just going to say , you know , they 're not allowed to do anything and they have to hide their faces all the time but -- So , I do n't know . But , um -- but I do n't , as far as the other guys I do n't know , but I thought it was kind of weird how when they were on -- you know , they showed that video ? Mhm . You know , of them being c - -- they looked like they were terrified , you know ? Oh , yeah . And -- and I 'm sure that they would be . But it -- I -- I do n't know . It seems like they 're all happy an- -- maybe they 're just happy to be out right now and do n't want to have to deal with everything that happened to 'em then . I do n't know . And all those bodies they found . Where were they from ? [several inaudible words ] Yep , yeah . Ooh . I do n't -- yeah , it - it 's sad . I ca n't imagine like , you know , all the parents and young wives and stuff , like , to have people out there . It 's got to be a scary thing , not knowing . I know . My husband and I were talking and we wonder if stuff like this keeps on if they 'll bring the draft back and young men , you know --
CT	If you 'd like me to send it to you I would . I would like it . Okay , what 's your email address ? E -- E.B.E.T.H. , ebeth . Okay . E.B.E.T.H. , ebeth . R -- R.D. R.D. Registered dietitian , that 's what I am . O- oh , okay . And that 's at AOL. At AOL , okay . I would really appreciate that . Yeah , I 've got a big list . And you just sign up and then -- I 'm -- I 'm doing pretty well wi - -- Really ? Yeah . A lot of people are . It 's just a -- I 'm , um , sort of -- I 've -- I- I worked in the mental health field for -- Uh-huh . -- many years and I 'm staying at home now and it 's -- you know , it 's a little shopping money for here and there , you know . Yeah . My husband 's still working and he 's getting ready to retire in about seven years so -- Uh-huh . But , ah , yeah , that 's -- and I -- I -- I do quite well . Some of the , um , some of the group , ah , like group discussions and stuff you can get in , you can make two hundred dollars . Y - -- like a focus group kind of thing ? Yeah , focus group but over the internet , yeah . Wow . And there 's -- I 'll -- I 'll type you a little letter , ah , or I 'll -- I 'll type a little something on there and explain more of it to ya and tell you which ones are the best . But I 'll give you the -- I 've probably got two hundred different companies you can sign up for and take surveys with . I 'd really appreciate that 'cause I love doing these little things . Mm , oh , I do too . I do too . It gives me -- it 's kind of a hobby for me now . And plus I make money with my hobby . And most hobbies cost you money so ... That 's -- that 's true . That 's true . But I 'll -- yes , I 'll more than be happy to send that to you . Uh-huh . Um , I have n't the young man , whether he 's , ah , done any surveys or not . He 's getting ready to go to Brazil . He 's a , uh , um , i- it 's sort of a -- he 's with the J- ah , Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints Church and he 's going to Brazil to be a missionary . Oh , holy smoke . And he was trying to make money to go . And he needs the money . Yeah , yeah . But , ah -- well , back to topic I guess here . Yeah . I -- I find , um -- I wish that there was a sports topic . I -- I know . I 'm like -- I 'm like the mi- -- peace in the Middle East , I was like --
CT	Yeah . -- and , uh , displacement of people who were already there . Yeah , and a - -- How do you feel about that ? About the Israeli occu- occupa- -- well , with , um , you know , just -- I do n't know if you 're very familiar with , like , beginning of time , how , like , you know , Israel being God 's chosen people and that sort of thing ? Are you very aware of , like , the -- the biblical history there ? I 'm -- I 'm aware of it , but more like a comic book . It does n't -- I mean , I 'm -- I 'm a -- Okay , it 's not really a -- I 'm a -- I 'm a scientist and so it -- it -- it really does n't , um , it does n't mean much to me , you know ? Okay . Well , just because you 're a scientist does n't have to -- I mean , it 's not -- but , I mean , historically -- No, but -- so -- so if , uh , well , what do you mean , historically ? So , I -- I mean , there were other people on the earth -- Yeah . Oh , oh , definitely . -- when it -- Yeah , w- whenever -- Right ? -- I say God 's ch - -- yeah , yeah , whenever I say God 's chosen people I do n't mean they 're the only ones that are going to go to heaven or anybody -- no , I do n't mean that at all . Um , but I do n't know if you , like , if you 've ever read as far as , like , in , you know , the beginning of ti- -- in , you know , in , like , Genesis and Exodus . I do n't know if you 've ev- are very familiar with , like , those , but how it talks about how God chose the people of Israel as his chosen -- chosen people , and as far as the conflict there , like , they were taken out ? Uh-huh . And I -- I 'd really -- I ca n't -- I 'm not -- I know the history but to go through it , it would take forever [several inaudible words ] . So you really feel that , like , the -- the current conflict in Palestine is -- is -- is -- is somehow related to what -- what the Torah says or -- or , uh , or what the New Testament says ? I -- I mean , is that a -- really a rational belief on your part ? Well , okay , I -- I ca n't say that , like , " Okay , what 's happening in this verse is like the prophesy is coming true " . But , I mean , I think in -- because , in my belief , God 's in control of everything and he 's planning out everything , you know ? In his plan , he knows what 's going on , he knows what 's happening . So , okay , it may be another -- thousands and thousands of years before actually I b - -- that God does come back , but I believe what 's happening now , it does play into a part . It 's kind of like just a sequence of events , I guess . It 's kind of like I said earlier , a precursor , and I -- I do believe that as far as what 's going on now , yeah , it is , it 's a rational belief . I mean , I think -- and you would even hear a lot of stories , a lot of scientists kind of -- there is evidence that would support that also .
CT	That 's true . I mean , they got us September eleventh . Mhm . Think of what they 're going to try and get with us next because America is , like , -- is really taking advantage of its power . The UN told America not to go and America said , " We 're going to go in without you " , you know ? Mhm . Actually , I saw that in -- in a way as the fall of the United Nations , the beginning of -- of the fall of the United Nations . If they 're going to be totally ignored , then what -- what purp- -- what , you know , what purpose are they -- will they be able to serve in the future . Mhm . So , um , it 's -- it 's just really sad and it 's unfortunate that , uh , this has happened and , like , you , uh , anything co- -- is possible , particularly after -- when we observe the events -- events of September eleventh , I know . What did you say about September eleventh ? When we -- when we reflect upon what happened September the eleventh , it is scary in light of the -- the , uh , current , uh , situation in the east . Uh , it is scary and I cannot imagine our children being that terrified , you know ? Mhm . Or all the suffering that 's involved , all the things that -- that we gloss over every day or take for granted every day . We have , uh , you know , uh , running water and -- and -- and , uh , other conditions here . We have food and we 're not , uh , -- our pla - -- our homes have -- have not been , um , destroyed or bombed or anything , so we have a lot to be thankful for in addition to the concerns , uh , the other , uh , things that are happening . Well , do -- do -- have you ever been involved in one of these conversations before ? No. No, and I think this is the answer to say , no , I have n't . Mhm . Okay . How -- how about you ? No, I 'm kind of figuring out what exactly , like , they 're looking for in the conversations . Well , I 've found this conver- -- our conversation quite interesting and inform - informative . Yeah . I could -- we do a - -- we -- we do agree on a number of things . Yeah . I 'm wondering if they were expecting us to disagree , you know , and -- -- to show , like , how a couple of [inaudible] , like , you know , go at it -- Mhm . -- but I think it -- extraordinarily enough , like , I feel , like , though , like , you 're going to have , like , strong opinions on it -- Mhm . -- I feel , like , the world really does n't -- I do n't know , sometimes I feel , like , people really do not agree with the war but then I realize that , like , it 's , like , people use the same exact reason to agree with the war that people use to disagree , like , they try and say we should have war --
CT	Well -- I do n't really think this had anything to do with it . I may be naive , but , ah , I think Israel 's a separate issue -- Yeah . -- and I think they keep trying to bring it in , but -- Well , everyone likes to tie everything to something else . Oh , ai n't that the truth . Yeah . You know , I mean , -- I think they 're both pigheaded myself . You know , it 's like , " Can't you all just work together " , yeah . Of course -- No. -- I feel that way about Republicans and Democrats , so -- Yeah , yeah , I know . Oh . It 's kind of crazy . It is . And all the -- the , um , the , um , actors and actresses . Oh . They 're about to drive me crazy . Ain't it the truth . It 's ridiculous . I know it . And -- I -- -- it -- -- you know , they have such unreal lives , you know , I just -- They -- it 's -- I do n't know . They 're -- and , and I do n't think that they 're -- they should -- it 's not their place to talk about it , you know what I mean ? Yeah , exactly . I mean , they can talk about it in their own personal lives , but not getting everybody -- Not to use that -- Yeah . -- their fame or whatever as a , I do n't know , trying to influence everybody . The thing is that , ah , um , they do n't seem to realize -- well , a lot of them are surprised that the general public -- the majority of the general public are not agreeing with them . Uh-huh . Because -- yeah , and 'cause they expected everyone to be like , " Oh , well yeah" , but instead , well the majority of the general public are saying , " What is wrong with you ?" , you know , and they do n't -- they 're not get- they do n't understand why . I know . And , um , I just think that 's kinda funny . Yeah . Well , they think -- they 're so used to being made stars of that -- Right . -- you know I guess they expect everybody to think like they do too . I do n't know . It 's ... But I do n't think it 's very smart . I know that if I was an entertainer that relied on the public 's view of me , I would not take sides on anything in as , as far as voicing my opinions . Mhm . Because you alienate so many people when you do that . Well , that 's true . But then you ca n't just not stand for anything . I do n't know . Yeah . But I think there 's a time and a place for it . Exactly . You know . I mean , I do n't know , I think that there 's just , um , -- I do n't know . It just seems , like , I would wanna -- so many of them are always saying that they want to keep their personal lives personal --
CT	Oh . I do n't either . As far as the mystery shopping stuff , you know , I get the email lists , but I do n't participate a whole lot in those either . Yeah . I currently do merchandising for a magazine company and I do , uh , a little bit of mystery shopping ; not a lot , I do n't really like mystery shopping that much , but I love the merchandising . I absolutely love it . I just got my first merchandising job ; in fact I was going to go out today and do it , but I 'm going to do it Thursday instead , but I 'm really excited about it . Oh , well , good . I have a permanent position . I know a lot of them are one time only . I go into the stores and scan the magazines for billing and reordering purposes . Okay . It 's a lot of fun . I do that once a week . Once a week . Okay . Mine 's once a month . It 's a -- it 's a permanent , but -- Oh , well that 's good . -- once a month for a couple of different stores . Um , but , no I ca n't wait . No, I 'm really looking forward to it -- [inaudible ] I do n't mind the mystery shopping , but I think the merchandising would be a lot more fun . Oh , yeah . Because you do n't have to conceal your identity . Mhm . And , you know , act sneaky . Yeah . Right . And I 'm really looking forward to it . But -- Well , good luck , I wish you good luck . Well , thank you . And whereabouts in Texas are you ? I 'm a little town called Paralean[ ? ] I 'm about , ooh , twenty minutes from Houston . Okay . Twenty minutes south , towards Galveston . Okay . What 's the temperature ? Oh , the temperature is up near the seventies . It 's a beautiful day outside . I bet you 're cold up there though , are n't you ? No. Actually , it 's about sixty today here . Oh , really . Yeah . Well , that 's really good . Yeah . Now , we 're getting one more blast of snow this week , but -- -- then I think we should be done . We 've had a really mild winter . You guys had snow down there though , did n't you ? Uh -- Somewhere in Texas ? Somewhere in Texas , but we do n't generally get that , we 're too close to the coast where it stays warm . Okay . It might snow , but it does n't hit the ground . It turns into water before it hits the ground . Okay . We get a lot of rain . We -- Do you ? -- we 've had a lot of floods here in the past couple of years . Really ? Mhm . I 'll never forget when I was -- oh , I was probably t- -- twenty , almost , well it was probably thirty years ago , I used to have relatives in Texas , um , they 've been out of there for many , many , many years , but we were driving down there ; my dad took the motorhome and he drove down there . He drove straight through , like I think he did it in like twenty six hours , straight through from Minnesota and we had come through bad blizzards all the way through , wow , all the way through Missouri for sure from here to there and it 's like three feet of snow packed up on the top of the motorhome and he said he drove through so fast he got down to Texas and was -- was on the freeways around Dallas and he still had snow flying off the top of the motorhome --
CT	-- did you play an instrument or ... ? I was learning how to play the piano . Okay . And I used to sing . So -- Okay . I guess that - that 's what -- I guess that 's one thing I really would change . Well , really but . Now , this is my second call . It 's funny I was n't expecting to get , you know , another call and I certainly was n't expecting to get asked the same question . But , once you really start thinking about it -- I mean , you know , I love my life . I -- you know , I do . I have a great life . I have great kids . I have an incredible husband . I 'm able to stay home , I mean . But , I just think back to , you know , now -- you know , I 'm older and I 'm -- I 'm super responsible . I have so many responsibilities now and it would have been nice for me to live a little bit more when I was young . You know , to experiment some more . You know , you know , to be more daring . Like I said , you know , try a job or that was , you know , where I had to travel new or somewhere where maybe I had never , you know , I did n't know anyone or something like that . But , I would never do it now . I mean , I could n't for one thing . But , I -- I , you know , I just could n't . So -- Yeah . -- I ca n't now , ever again , you know ? Till I retire maybe and the kids are gone and my husband and I can do some of that stuff . But , you know what I mean ? Yeah , I -- Oh . -- understand 'cause I guess now -- Yeah . -- you know , you have bills to pay and -- Yeah . -- you know , you ca n't just be , ah , id - idealistic -- Right . -- about it . You ca n't -- Right . -- just go and say , " Well , hey , well tomorrow I 'm just going to let -- just backpack through Europe just because .. . " Yeah , right ! Or I 'm -- I 'm going to just , you know , I 'm going to be a artist . Yes . " I 'm just going to st- stop working and just sell paintings for a living . There I go" . Yeah . Yeah , well -- You know . -- I mean , I think about what I used to live on every month , you know , as far as a wage . My gosh , how did I do it ? I mean -- Yeah , that 's -- -- how did I survive ? Because , I look at my bills now and I go , " Oh , man , ooh la la " yeah , but , um ... Yeah . I think that 's when you have -- you know , tell me -- are you -- where you worry less about those things 'cause I guess then , you know , everyone , you know , was like , " Wow , just deal , whatever " .
CT	-- holy moly . So she -- she 's -- she quit college but -- Mhm . -- her oldest one is now fifteen so -- and her youngest one is eleven , so she 's gone back to school . Oh , good for her . And they 're kind of on their own , you know . Yeah , they 're old enough to be able to take care of the basics and -- Yes . -- handle themselves -- Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah -- -- while mum 's studying . -- they 're good kids . Oh , well , good for her being -- They 're -- they 're good kids and she worked and put her -- helped to finish putting her husband through school , so -- -- so , he said it was her turn now , so she 's gone back . Goodness gracious . She sounds like quite a lady . And she 's really excited about it . That 's wonderful . So , she likes the nursing and she 's going to stick with that ? I think so . Good for her . Yeah , she works in the accounting department where she works . That 's hilarious . I -- Is that not funny ? -- ca n't -- ah , gosh . Well , you know , it really is where the money is . Yeah . I mean literally ! This is -- this is true . Oh that 's -- This is true . Well , I think it 's a good skill and I think accounting 's a -- a skill that you pick it up with experience not necessarily from classes -- Ah , you 're right . -- well -- You 're right . -- everybody I know who 's studied accounting ended up having to completely change their accounting why of thinking -- Right . -- when they went to work for their respective companies . Right 'cause it does n't work the way the book says it does . No. Everybody has a different method . You know , there is n't any one standard way . Right . I mean , I guess it 's -- it 's good if you really want to get in to tax issues and -- Yeah , yeah . -- and , ah , theory and all that stuff , but -- Yeah , but we -- well , I just -- I just knew . I 'm not really an accountant , I 'm a bookkeeper . Oh that 's -- Yeah . -- that 's an accountant . I do n't -- believe me , I do n't see much difference there . I really do n't . There 's -- there 's not a hell of a lot -- No. -- that I can see . Just a different -- different total . Oh , yeah , more or less , and a bigger pay cheque . Well , I 'm -- I 'm interested . How did you get signed up for this ? The [several inaudible words ] . Off the internet . Yeah , me too . Me too . I do secret shopping in my --
CT	Everybody 's waiting to see what 's going to go on in the world . Yeah , I know , I know . Well , I heard somewhere that if Saddam Hussein says he 's not leaving they might even go in before the forty eight hours . Yeah , well -- I heard that somewhere . -- that 's what they 're concerned with . Um -- um -- Oh . -- doing a preemptive strike -- Uh-huh . -- and , um ... Oh . And d- United States knows he 's not going to leave . But , I ca n't necessarily say I blame him for that either . Yeah . I mean , if the shoe was on the other foot would Bush leave the White House ? So -- Well , no , I do n't think so . -- ah , yes , ah -- -- I do n't think so . -- I ca n't necessarily blame him for that . Sometimes people need to be a little less political [inaudible] , a little more human -- Mhm . -- and we can understand a lot more what 's going on ... Right , right . In this whole thing . Yeah . So , um , if I take the million dollars I 'll have to give you some of it ? No ? W- we can go shopping . Yeah , right . Well , I 'll have to come to Philadelphia and see the snow then . Well -- -- I 'm trying to get down there to see some sandy beach . Yeah , right -- [several inaudible words ] -- and then they tell you that there 's life in the water and then -- then there 's , ah , bacteria in the water . Do n't go in the water . Mm . The wonderful looking water that -- that you should n't go in anyway . Yes , it 's nice . Mm . Yeah . It 's nice . I know . Whoever thought on the planet that seventy percent at least of all fresh water is frozen in the north and south pole . We would -- Oh , really ? -- think that we ca n't drink water or have any water to drink . Uh-huh . That -- that makes no sense to me . No, not really . You -- you can dig -- you can dig oil from below the sand and below the ocean -- Mhm . -- run some pipelines and put some plants up there on them polar caps and melt down on our water we got sitting . Mhm . Well , I do n't know -- But , we spend more -- -- maybe they should just -- -- money on death than life , you know , we -- -- man kind of has this suicidal spirit . I believe it . Think so ? We spend far more on death than life . Oh . So -- Yeah , o - on things -- -- what do you think -- what do you think of philosophy then ?
CT	Was it bad or ... ? Oh , I just thought it was kind of sh - shallow . Uh-huh . You know uh ... and I saw the Joe Millionaire ? Uh-huh . And -- and that was -- it was good but then in other ways it was kind of tacky . Uh-huh . Because they -- it seemed like they were all competing for this rich guy that ... you know , and he was n't really rich . It was all just a big lie . Yeah . . But I did think the g- -- the right girl won . Yeah , yeah . I do too , I really do . But I mean , even though they did n't continue to have a relationship , you know ? I still believe that he made the right choice . Sure . I -- I think so too . Everybody else seemed kind of -- like , in for it for the money or whatever they could get off of it . Yeah . You know , and they would go -- do anything , go anywhere and I thought that was pretty tacky . Yes . But -- but she held out . She , you know , she held -- uh , kept her values . Yes , she did . So , I thought that was pretty cool . Yeah and she was very family oriented . I mean , just even her lifestyle , the way she lived her life , you know ? With -- you know , she -- you know , she was a caretaker ? Did you know that ? Yes . She took care of her grandmother or something ? I think she took care of older -- uh , she worked for , like , a old folks ' home ? Uh-huh . And took care of um , you know , old people . Yes . That 's what she did . -- I mean , that -- that says a lot about her right there . Oh yeah , that takes a lot patience and , you know ... Yeah . ... maturity , I think . Yeah . To be able to put up with other people 's disabilities and ... and then she was really family oriented . She -- I liked what she said that sh - -- the first thing she 'd do with the money , her share of the money is to buy stuff for her family . Oh , yeah . And she said -- I guess her aunt had cancer so everything was gonna go towards , you know , helping her aunt to get better , to recover , you know . Yes . So ... I mean , that seemed she -- she saved all the necklaces and the jewelry and everything to sell it so that -- Yeah , that -- -- she could take care of her . That really takes a lot of uh ... well , maybe it does n't take a lot for her , you know -- Uh-huh . -- but for a lot of people , they just want to keep it .
CT	You do n't read , ah ha ! Stupid ! I always read the small -- the smi- -- the ... I 'm sorry , I always read the small print . Oh , I u- -- I do . The thing is , I signed up for this over a month and a half ago and so much has happened between now and then , you know ? I -- and I signed up for a lot of different uh survey setups so I -- I was n't sure which ones had which setups on 'em any more . And I -- the only info I could find on the email was , you know , how to -- how the calls would work . Did n't -- did n't actually say anything about the parameters . Nope . So , you do a lot of surveys by mail , huh ? Yeah . I -- I 've uh found it 's a good way to pick up spare cash in my free time . I 've been signing up but I tell you what ? All 's I 'm getting is a chance to win this or a chance to win that , no cash really . There 's a site on the web -- Not going into the right ones , I guess . -- where -- there 's a site on the web somewhere that lists them all and you go through them and maybe one out of ten or maybe one out of twenty actually pays per survey . I see . You do n't have to pay any money out to get on any of 'em ? None of the reputable ones . I do n't bother with the ones that try and -- try and scam ya out of -- Right . and as I told my mum when I was looking for this stuff , if anybody asks you for an upfront fee for you to work for them , it 's a scam . I mean , it may not be but the odds are that it is . Okay . Back to the subject . Right . So , if you did take that , how do you feel it would affect you in the long run ? In the long run ? Actually , probably not too much because , I mean , he 's a - -- actually about to move away anyways . We 're both uh going our separate ways in a year or two , so it would just mean parting about a year -- year and half earlier . Mhm . So , in the long run , it would n't affect me but still , you know , never even to be able to just drop -- drop him a phone call , you know ? I do n't know . Again , like I say , it depends on the details . The details are important and we -- you never get details in a hypothetical . It 's always so black and white . Mhm . Well , I would think that maybe you could n't talk to 'em personally but you could have a go between , you know ? Talk for ya , back and forth then you would n't be breaking the rules .
CT	And , ah -- anyway , that 's my opinion . So , now -- -- what do you think ? Well , when I went to high school , especially middle school in high school , um -- of course I 've -- you know , I 've -- I 've always loved to learn so , I -- I love taking challenging courses and I took a lot of my education seriously , but I just notice that because of the lack of , I guess , um , some of -- some of the teachers , like you said , there are some that are highly dedicated , but because of some of the lack of motivation for some of the teachers , it just ended up being like a farm house . You know , there 'd be students that -- they -- you know , I had an -- an algebra class actually in high school and the teacher talked about baseball the whole time and so he 'd give us our assignments and then talk with like those that were on the baseball team and football team about sports all the time , which was n't necessarily bad , but it just was n't very productive for our time and -- Right . Mhm . So , I -- I think -- I think with the public system , I mean there 's flaws and I wish -- like I think if -- I do n't how , since they 're spending so much money on -- on , you know , anti terrorism and so forth right now -- Mm . -- but um if they could increase maybe the payroll of some of the teachers then it would be more appealing to people out in the -- you know , in the job market to become teachers , especially when they have a talent to teach really well . Yeah , well -- And so , I think , ah , that 's how you can improve public education a lot , is maybe by paying the teachers more , so it 's more appealing and -- But -- -- and also making it more organized . -- but I think is they need to be worth their pay . Right . You know , so the criteria needs to be stricter maybe though . Yeah , I would agree . For the -- for them to become teachers and -- you know , because not just anybody can do it . Uh-huh . Um and it has to be people that are very , um , oriented with kids . It ca n't just be , you know , someone that 's just smart . You know what I mean ? Right . Someone who 's willing to -- who 's good with the kids and to get right down there , you know , and sometimes the older teachers just do n't have it , you know , th - the kids just do n't respect them . Right . And , ah , they have to keep that respect and -- and that 's another thing I see in public school , is that it seems like there 's so little respect for each other -- Uh-huh . -- and for teachers and , um , you know , they 're -- they 're -- because they have to be there --
CT	Um . It 's like it just slipped my mind , um ... But ah basically having it so that they -- if someone can get hired for the color of their skin its ' really scary , because you get people into an office , especially in -- ah , where social services and other things like that and it -- so that they -- they -- they 're basically guaranteed -- affirmative action , that was the name of it , but ah -- that they 're guaranteed their job just because they have a certain color of skin . The problem with that is that they can get in there and then they -- then nobody can get rid of them and get somebody who can actually do the job properly and -- ah , especially in governmental positions and stuff like that . But it 's a really scary place to be because they have people 's lives in their hands and if they do n't know what they 're doing , then we 're in real trouble . Right . It 's -- But ah -- -- really -- really bad when you 're turned away -- Yeah . -- from something that you know so much about , just because you just happen to not fit the quota . Exactly and , ah , I kn- -- I mean , fortunately I 've never personally been in that situation , just simply because I 've generally gone out and gone into my own business because that 's what I like to do . But ah I think that a lot of people are more willing to just get a job that will be there and they just want something that 's safe and dependable that they do n't have to deal with any risk and , ah , unfortunately a lot of them are n't willing to actually do their job . They just want a job that pays them and they want to do what they want to do in the process . And that 's one of the reasons this country has got a lot of the problems it does is because people who 've gotten where they wanted , depend on the government to take care of them , instead of them taking care of the government . Yeah . Which is a little scary , but ah anyhow -- Yeah , it is . -- a -- and -- and -- I -- I do n't mean to -- I -- I 'm forty four , I 'm just curious as to how old a student you are . Are you in your tw- -- I 'm twenty three . Oh , okay . So , you 're in your -- Yeah . -- early twenties . So , you 're -- are you a senior at this point then ? Yeah . Okay . So , you 're -- you 're getting close to -- to getting out and getting into the --to the real world -- Yeah , hopefully just one more semester . -- so to speak . And a - are you in school -- ah , what area of the country do you go to school in ?
CT	Die Hard ? Oh yeah . I watched all those . Yeah , the ones that I do n't like to watch in , you know -- is , ah , horror movies . Horror . Yeah , I -- Yeah , I do n't like those . -- I like some if they 're not too scary . But if they 're too scary -- Mhm . -- I just close my eyes the whole time , so it 's no point in watching it . Yeah . Because I 'm a baby , I ca n't -- it would-- Yeah , I do n't like it either . I would n't be able to sleep if I watch them . Oh , same here . Yeah . Yeah , and then the most gory[ ? ] movie that -- I do n't -- I would never want to watch again -- What ? -- is , ah , Casino . Oh , yeah they killed everyone . Have you seen that ? Yeah , and the way they killed was so brutal that -- Yeah . -- you know , I watched it on -- on , um , video -- Uh-huh . -- but yeah , theatre would have been pretty bad I think for me . Oh , I 'm sure . Yeah . Yeah . I felt like it -- like , I remember a couple of years ago when these movies came out , I watched about three movies all at the same time that were all like the same kind of movie -- Mhm . Snatch , Blow and Traffic . Oh -- You know , those -- -- that 's a long time ago , huh ? Yeah , but -- Yeah . -- all three of those movies came out around the same time and Blow , Snatch -- Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . -- and Traffic , they all seemed like the same movie over and over again . Lots of drugs , lots of people dying or at least , you know , getting shot -- Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . -- it seemed like all the same movie . But I remember I saw all three of those movies in like a span of two weeks and then -- You did , huh ? -- I could - -- and I could n't remember which movie happened to w- -- you know , what happened in which movie because they all just blended together . Uh-huh . You know , at the theatre you can really get into the story and , you know , [several inaudible words ] video too huh , even i- -- it -- even if it 's a smaller screen -- But sometimes with videos , like you can talk and you can do other things so -- Mhm . -- maybe you 're not so attached to it . Yeah . Yeah -- I think the best movie ever on big screen was -- Uh-huh . -- ah was Mi- -- ah , Mission Impossible . Oh ! I loved that on the big screen . That was good , huh ?
CT	And also I 'm guessing all those , you know , upper class people or some people , you know , related to Saddam Hussein have left the country already , you know , or they might having , like , vacations somewhere nicer , you know . Right . I do n't think that they are gonna be staying there , so all those [inaudible ] ordinary people -- Mhm . -- no place to go to , you know , to move to , so -- and also , like , women and children , you know . Yeah . So , if you wanted to actually -- I was gonna say , if you wanted to actually help their country , each time they let a missile off , I think someone was telling me it 's like a million dollars for each missile that they let off . That 's money that you could put into the country to -- to help the country rather than bringing the country down and then you say you wanna rebuild the country . That -- that -- that makes no sense whatsoever . Mhm . That 's true . ' Cause some people told me that , I mean , you know , all those , you know , um , missiles are -- I mean , if -- from the American perspective , after the war their economy is gonna get better because they need to , you know , um , produce , like , those army product- prod - products , supplies . Mhm . So , they need to hire more people , more labor . I -- I do n't know where it started , but in terms -- from the American perspective the war might affect positively on their economy , e- especially , you know , the economy in this country has been really , really slow and unemployment -- unemployment is really high . Right . So , I do n't know which way -- A lot of companies are -- are -- are cutting their due to the war . So . Yeah . Yeah . And -- and so forth . So , it -- it 's not helping the economy at all because -- Oh . -- a -- a lot of companies , you know , they 're cutting their workforces because they 're not making as much money as -- as they usually would be making . I was just watching something about the airlines . They 're gonna be cutting a lot of employees 'cause people are -- are afraid to fly right now , so it 's -- it 's not gonna help the economy . It -- it may get better in the end , and then again it -- it may not . If you think about what happened September the eleventh , the con- -- the economy has n't gotten any better since then . Oh , that 's true . Yeah . It has been really slow since then , right . But , um , well -- but the c - -- the country has to send a lot of , you know , military supplies to the servicemen in I- Iraq right now . Right . So , they 've got to spend all the , you know , stocks -- stock -- they -- they -- I -- I 've heard that since there was not any major war or major fight i- in the world --
CT	Yeah . Are those your kids ? No. Um , I work in a school but it 's a proprietary school . Oh , okay . Okay . But , um , that -- they smoke outside . You know , they have to smoke outside . It 's a non smok - -- the building is non smoking . Yeah . Ah , is n't that interesting . Mhm . So , you 're at work right now ? No, I 'm at home . Okay . Yeah . ' Cause I hear lots of noise in the background . That 's because we have the , um -- we rented a -- this DVD , um -- -- or bought it , rather . It was , uh -- what is it ? After -- Friday [inaudible] , yeah , that 's it . Oh , okay . Never heard of it . And my husband happen to have the TV always has it so loud . Oh , is he -- has he -- does smoking affect his hearing ? No, he just -- for some reason it 's because he got that , um , that bowls entertainment center , you know -- Oh , yeah . -- in the -- in the house and so he likes to be in -- like he 's in a theater or something . Surround sound . Surround sound . Right , that 's it , surround sound . That 's it . I 'm going like -- Well , do you go -- I used to bowl and I would come home and wash everything . I mean , I would n't even wear a coat in because I knew I was gonna come home smelling like cigarette smoke . Oh , really ? And , um , and I 'm not so sure that 's where I did n't really get asthma -- Oh , okay . -- or that it was n't complicated by that -- Mhm . -- then , um -- but it 's , uh , anybody that knows me knows that , uh , they cannot smoke in my house or my car . Right . But if they wanna go someplace with me and they smoke -- Mhm . -- I 'm happy to stop as many times as I need to . Okay , yeah . But that means -- that means we need to leave an hour earlier . Right . So , if we need to be there by eight in the morning , we have to leave at seven . Oh , okay . I see . I see . So ... and -- and I think that 's fair for me . It is . It is , and I would rather drive because if we go in their car then -- Car then you ca n't -- you do n't have a choice if -- I do n't have a choice . Right . Yeah . Now , some people , like my girlfriend , um , my husband smokes and she does n't and she -- and she does n't allow it in her house , so he smokes out on the patio when we go visit her . Mhm . But if she 's in our car , he 's gonna smoke and she 's gonna fuss and that 's gonna be a back and forth thing .
CT	Uh-huh . They get all these people that come in and -- and California 's hit the worst because they come straight up from Mexico long enough to have a child and then the whole family can move in . Ah , I 'm -- And they 're supporting them . I 'm sure they are pregnant when they get here anyway . Well , well , yeah , they 're pregnant . They 're ready to deliver . Uh-huh . They come in at eight months . Uh-huh , I 'm sure . And , you know , they 're not even established , they just come in long enough to have that child . It 's an American citizen . Then the whole family gets to stay , and California is absolutely -- I mean , it 's busting their budgets because they have to pay medical on all these people because they do n't have jobs . Wow , that 's interesting . Yeah , you know . So -- so where is our freedom ? Our freedoms are being taken away more and more every day . Mm . I -- I , like I said , I totally agree . Yeah , you know . It 's an interesting situation in California . Yeah , it is and , I mean , California is a big state , there 's no doubt about it , but as you get more people that are not working , than are working , then it 's going to affect the whole government . Mm . Not just California . Mhm . You know , so anyway , that 's just my opinion for what it 's worth . Well , like I said , I -- I -- I definitely agree , um . And what California voted on that for was to try and control it , not let these people come in -- in and in a week have a baby and then take up citizenship . Yeah , but -- We 're a free country and anybody has the right to live here , there is no doubt but that 's not the way to do it . Mhm , I agree . I agree . That is actual fact , an actual fact . Okay , so what else do we have to do now ? I think we just have to keep talking about censorship . Oh , okay . Um , you did bring up -- I mean , you brought up an excellent point with the -- with the guns and -- and -- and the fact that we do n't have freedoms . Uh-huh . And -- and , you know , like I say I just want to reiterate the fact that , you know , we 're taking -- we 're taking the -- the -- the raising of the children from the families . That 's right . And just putting it in the hands of the government and what -- like , I said , what blows my mind is that they can tell us this is what we want and -- That 's right . And almost as if we were in a trance , we -- we -- we , you know , shake our head and agree , yeah , this is what we want and --
CT	-- sneak the stuff by us , you know , and I think that 's horrible . They have to -- they have to let you without any advance notice -- And that 's again why , you know -- -- according to the law . -- we 're sending part of the resource [inaudible ] to a private school -- And so a lot of parents do n't know that , a lot of parents think they have to call and make an appointment . -- they 're very structured in what they tell the children and they think that this kind of stuff should be taught at home . And they do n't , like -- Um , and , yeah , they grease over parts of it when they get older but they do n't go in depth and -- and hand out condoms and things like that because they do n't believe in it and they believe it 's wrong . They are not , you know , if they are not doing anything wrong what 's the -- what would be the problem ? You know , and that 's what I believe , you know , that 's not something that , you know , an eighth grader or ninth grader needs to know or care about . You know , they should be worrying about other things . Mhm . Well , exactly , you know , but they 're forcing children to grow up early by teaching them this kind of stuff and by putting it out there , putting it out on the table -- Mhm . -- you know , they would n't know about it and they would n't care but it 's bringing attention to it so it 's -- it 's drawing the kids into it . And I think that that -- that 's bad and that 's where part of our problem is coming from , because the society -- Mhm , yeah , yeah . -- is just going to pot because -- I 'm lucky in that regard . -- they teach 'em what they want but they do n't teach 'em the morals and the responsibilities -- No. -- that go with it . My daughter 's not , like , the other -- you know most of the girls are , " Oh , I have a boyfriend " and things like -- I mean , I did n't even think about until I was maybe in high school . Well , there 's nothing wrong with that . I mean , unfortunately all that stuff comes quick enough but you do n't need to force it . Yep , I agree . My son was only -- he 's going to be six in June and that 's -- Mhm . -- you know , it 's good that they are naive , that 's what children are supposed to be , you know , and unfortunately they 're forced to grow up so quickly now with everything , you know , and it 's like that is -- Yeah . Like , that should be the last thing on their mind at , you know -- So , I mean , I 'm lucky that way because she 's not . At that young age , you know .
CT	And this is Barbara . Just about , yeah . A- -- Like , yeah , censorship , um , I think it can lead to -- to even -- Um , neither do I. -- more ills and -- and woes and control that we do n't want to have , I think , that reading can help develop a sense of responsibility if those communication lines are kept open and nurtured and when kids are reading they 're encouraged to ask questions -- Correct , um , -- -- and to talk about things that trouble them or concern them -- About the only thing I might -- -- or the things that they like or -- -- disagree upon is , um , if it 's , um , used in a harmful way . Yeah , I guess we can all do our part -- Correct . -- because it 's a -- it 's a topic that comes up from time to time and I know that as taxpayers we have a say in what happens in th - -- our public , our local public school system . I do n't have any children in school . I think parents of children who are in school have even more power -- Right . -- and more say -- And it -- it -- it 's a ban , uh , uh , like a book club or -- -- in things like censorship or no censorship . Oh , okay . They 're like the stake holders in this whole thing . Oh . Correct Mhm . Exactly , and -- and I just hate to think of the way it -- it snowballs out of control and , uh , you know , uh , these people go out and start burning things and having these bonfires and throwing books on 'em and , you know , that 's what scares me . It -- it turns into like a mob scene , a -- Mm . Well , I know , uh , growing up myself , um , we probably were restricted , though , in reading from a private school more than we were restricted when I entered a public school system , so , um , therefore I went to the public -- Exactly . -- school system because I had the freedom to -- -- and the only way -- -- choose what books I wanted . -- anything can be accomplished is to talk about it , not to -- -- and at the private school we were not . -- you know , form an angry mob and burn and -- and destroy , but rather be creative and -- and communicate . Mhm . But then -- but then they also did n't [ ?] , um , because it was a private school , it was , um , more religious an- based , so you had , um , the freedom to read anything pertaining to , uh , uh , religious , um , medias and able to read , uh , freely and teachers were teaching a religion class at that time . Yeah , we used to say the pledge of allegiance every day or daily and I believe that is ruled out now ... so , mm . Right , correct , choose to and if -- and I do know , um , um , children here in our area that go to the private schools , um , they might not be that , um , um , religion but they are able to , um , freely choose what books they read , um , at their school , but in -- but in the other essence at the public schools , um , it 's -- you have more freedom to read whatever you want to read in the public schools , there 's a lot more freedom there than the private school sector . And I went to both and I have brothers and sisters that went to all private and there was only two of us allowed to go to the public because our parents thought that was less of an education but , yeah , we turned out pretty good . Correct . My -- my parents definitely encouraged reading , um , we were giving -- given more play time if we read more books and -- and , um , when my mother let us go to the public library or little book store she did not -- uh , she wanted to see the books but she did n't -- she never said , " No , you ca n't read that " . Mhm . So , um , um , we grew up reading and being awarded for reading . Yeah . So did my brother and he was given an award for reading about every book that they had in the library , so , but that 's -- that was eight years of school , so you could about read every book . So , uh Correct , yeah , any time you read , um , you have that , uh , freedom and new possibilities and more knowledge , um , so I -- I disagree on censoring , um , reading materials in the school system . Correct . Mhm . Correct . Um , yes , and when we were going to school my mother was active in the , uh , school system and PTAs and , uh , parental guidance and , um , I know that we did n't have , um , a -- a censoring of -- of books when I was going through the system , um , and today I would , uh , hope that our children and the children children after that would be able to , uh , freely read and be able to give that knowledge to someone else . Right , because one person 's attitude towards one piece of , uh , information from a book should be banned and if you congregate ten people , um , and they all disagree , then who 's really right ? Correct .
CT	Right . You know . Um You know -- Uh We talk to my grandchildren , you know , when certain issues come up we talk to them , but we plug it into something that gives them a foundation , we do n't just throw a crazy idea out there that scares them to death . My little three year old granddaughter is in a --in a daycare and , uh , they 're reading books about monsters . She 's never learned about monsters at home . Oh ! She 's terrified of monsters . She sees monsters in closets , monsters in an empty dog kennel . She sees monsters out -- under her bed . She learned this in daycare . Who gave them the right to bring up monsters ? Why are n't they playing with baby dolls and tea sets and little toy trucks and things like that ? Oh , poor kid . Yeah . I mean , she looks under her bed for shoes and there 's a monster . Somebody needs to be making decisions based , uh , you know -- and that 's my daughter in law 's fault , you know , she should be checking out what they 're , um , uh , my son is a single parent , you know , but his wi - ex wife put her in this daycare . Uh huh . And she does n't check to see what they 're learning there , you know . But Katy 's terrified . Yeah . And so I -- I believe that certain books should be censored . I believe the parents should have a right to censor them , saying , " My child is not ready for this " or , " I do n't want my child exposed to this " . Well , what grade do you believe maybe that should be lifted , that censorship ? Or never ? I think it depends on , you know , there are certain things , books , that my grandchildren see in , uh , in their private school , they go to a christian school , that public schools would n't allow , you know . Right . And so censorship , what 's right and wrong , is in the hands of those who have authority , you know . Uh huh . You have to have something that you base it on . There 's a reason we 've got them in a private school because of what they 're learning in public school , and not learning . My -- my second grade grandchild can read as good an eighth grader because she 's learning phonics . Mhm . You know . But they 're not teaching that in public school , so -- I really believe , you know , the constitution places a child in the ri- in the hands of the parents , not in the hands of the teachers . And I really believe that 's where it belongs and I believe the parents should have a right to see the curriculum , what books are gonna be used , what , uh , subject matter is gonna be brought up , you know , if it 's anything other than reading , writing and arithmetic , you know . But I 'm coming from sixty years of parenting and grand parenting .
CT	I do n't like the step thing , though , you know like the aerobics stuff ? Yeah . I do n't like that too much . I like just the regular floor aerobics . Mhm . Like that . I like them . Have you ever tried spinning ? No. I have n't -- I have n't worked up the nerve to do that yet . It looks really hard . And sometimes , like , you know , that magazine , fitness magazine ? Mhm . Like , sometimes I 'll do some of the things that are in there -- Oh . -- because sometimes they have , like , a page of just the exercises that you can try to do for whatever , you know , your legs -- Mhm . -- or your stomach or whatever . Mm . Sometimes I like them . I like to , like , make my own routine and I just like put on the music sometimes -- Mhm . -- and then I 'll do my own thing , like , with the bicep curls or , you know ? Yeah . And the calf raises . The what ? You ever do them , the calf raises ? You can do them just , like , around your house , like , you do n't have to have a machine or anything . Ahah . And you can just , like , hold onto , like , if you have a tall dresser or whatever -- Mhm . -- or the back of a chair and you just , like , lift up on your toes . Oh , okay , okay . You know what I 'm talking about ? I know what you 're talking about now -- [inaudible ] -- ahah . But you can feel them after like ten min . You 're like , " Whoa" . And the one I said , it 's , like , " Do , like , eighty of them " and I 'm , like , " Oh , my God " . Golly . But I do them to , like , music , so -- Mhm . [inaudible ] -- like , the time passes by real fast . Mhm . See , I have to work on my legs , that 's what I want to work on and my stomach , but not until after the baby . Mhm . You ca n't really do anything , I do n't think , when you 're [inaudible] . No. I -- I know the -- I wo n't even try it . Yes , I know the limit . You know , like , I 'll do -- I 'll do like bicep curls or something -- Mhm . -- but I do n't want to try anything with my stomach . Some of our friends that are pregnant go to the water aerobics . Oh , yeah , I heard of those . That 's just -- that 's just really cool because then you do n't even feel pregnant -- Mhm . -- because you 're , like , weightless . Mhm . They say by the time you 're done it 's -- you 're pretty much like you 're playing around in the water , but when you 're done , you 're actually tired --
CT	-- try and figure out where everybody was . So , for -- for me it 's sort of like -- -- you know , it 's sort of like I look at it before and after because my outlook just on , you know , that -- you know , everything is not always -- you 're going to be as peaceful as it was before . Yeah . Just sort of really -- you know , dramatically changed because -- It is a -- it is an eye opener . Yeah . I mean up until -- up until that point , you know , I would never -- I would n't think twice about , you know , flying for one or , you know -- I mean who would -- nobody would think that people would fly planes into , you know , buildings . I mean I just -- Right , yeah . -- who -- who would have ever thought that . Yeah . You know , but it just -- it just forces you to look at things differently now and , you know , I think -- I think in addition to being patriotic just to -- to like value , uh , you know , relationships you have with people and -- Did it make you -- did n't it make you realize just how much those people hate us ? What from other countries ? Yeah , the terrorists , the ones that -- Yeah but -- and I -- and I think the thing is like , I mean , for me it seems like that what -- what they hate us for is like , you know , our biggest strength , you know . Yeah . Like because we 're free and that 's what we value so much is what the other countries , you know , hate us for so it 's like you -- you can hav- -- it 's hard to like to have all the freedoms we have and not , you know , be targeted and , you know , it 's sort of like -- seems like it 's a price sometime for being as free as we are that other people are gonna wanna , you know , do stuff or whatever . But we welcome 'em to come here and be free with us . Yeah . I mean , you know , I mean I 'm sort of , uh , you know , obviously everything that happened was horrible but at the same time I sort of -- I sort of cringe when there 's a lot of , you know , crack downs on civil liberties and , you know , just -- you know , it 's like -- it 's just a personal thing of how much you 're willing to give up to feel safe , you know . Mhm . I mean some people think , um , you know , something is going too far while , you know , others would rather , you know , have that and feel safer , you know , just like -- it 's a tough line to cross as far as , you know , what they 're doing with , you know , ashcroft and all that . You know , well , is it really protecting us or is it making people more fearful ? It 's -- it 's , uh , it 's tough , you know , to decide .
CT	But , I mean , I -- I knew people that knew people but it did n't really have such a close to home effect on me . Right . Now you think if you would have actually known someone , you think your life -- you would have changed your life at all ? I -- not long term . No, I do n't think so either . I , ah , -- I mean , I still go about my life -- I do have to admit though I -- I -- am , um , -- I 'm more aware . I mean , I -- I -- I 'm more aware of my surroun- -- oh , yeah , one change , I do carry a cell phone with me all the time and I have programmed in my , ah , my wife 's telephone number and my daughter 's cell phone number and I 've asked her of course to , ah , you know , to -- to always keep their cell phones on , just in -- if God forbid anything were to happen again I could get in touch with them , I guess , because , um , I think that would be important if anything were to ever happen , I -- I would like to be able to -- I , you know , the accounts of the people being able to call their loved ones , uh , I thought was kind of comforting , I guess , to a certain extent , you know . Yeah . But , ah , I do n't know , I wo n't -- I guess I just wo n't -- I do n't want to believe that they can -- they can win , they can beat me I guess is what it amounts to and if I give in then I will -- I mean , like , remember all that stuff just recently with the , ah , you know , putting the , ah , plastic up around your house and all that kind of -- I thought that was kind of silly , did n't you ? I did n't even hear about that . I try not to watch the news . Oh , there you go . Wh - -- Where are you from ? Um , Michigan . Oh , you 're in Mich-, see I 'm on the east coast , I 'm near , um , -- are you familiar at all with -- I 'm near , I 'm in Trenton , near Trenton New Jersey . I 've heard of Trenton . Okay , so , like , right after the , um , you know , the thing that happened with the , ah , -- with nine one one was the anthrax scare . Oh , yeah . Well , guess what , we have a major , um , postal , um , distribution , I guess is what they call it here , well those letters came out of that -- that postal , um , distribution plant , I guess for want of a better word . So there was that little scare too that , ah , I do have to -- yeah , I do remember now . My wife does handle mail at her place of business and at that time she was near Princeton . They have since moved and , ah , she did -- I went out and bought her plastic gloves and she did wear , ah , you know , a face mask and all that kind of stuff just in case something wa - -- was to happen . But even at that , knowing that it was right in the area , you know , they -- they actually arrested some people in this area , um , um , concerning the anthrax and I do n't know , I just figured yeah , I 'm not gonna worry about it , you know , um , I 'm gonna go about and live my normal life and , ah , that 's the way it is . I 'm just trying to think what else I 've , ah , -- what else I 've done . Other than the cell phone , put some water away , other than that , that 's about it . I -- I 'm not gonna let 'em beat me , right ?
CT	But -- but I have to allow for the possibility of a long stay behind some lines . Right , that 's the thing -- And so it 's changed the frequency that I do short trips . It does n't stop me from doing , oh , a trip with the family across the country but it stops me from popping up to New York to visit with my sister for just a -- just a day , which I used to do every once in a while where we had family business meetings and I would go up there in the morning and come back , dragged out late at night and I have n't made a trip like that in more than two years . Well , I -- I still have family in New York and I usually drive up on the weekends but I have n't really done that in a while and not because of the nine eleven , it 's just I hate driving up there , um , the what , seven hours and then driving back . Yeah . So -- so that 's the only deterrent . Other than that , you know , I would be going all the time but , um , my plans are still the same . I mean right now , I mean I 'm in downtown Norfolk and , um , when it happened they sent us home because we -- I 'm in the building where , ah , the World Trade Centre is across the street and the Federal building is like two -- a couple of blocks away and then I 'm in where the coastguards are in the building , you know , so they started patrolling the halls and , um , we were more aware of security and that , you know , everyone was watching and every time they -- every -- people here were nervous because every time they would hear something they were like , " Okay , what was that ? " You know , are they bombing , letting something go or what , you know , so it was , um , -- I guess the other people would make you scared . You know , um , I did n't worry about it much but seeing the other people being worried , you know , kind of like it was contagious . I live not far from Dulles Airport and it was wonderful when everything was grounded and then shortly afterwards when there were just a few flights flying , because instead of being noisy pretty much until about ten in the evening it was nice and quiet all day long . Yeah . You could hear the neighbors cutting their grass a mile away . Oh . And now it 's kind of just the opposite . It 's not that the skies are so busy or so noisy but it 's that whenever I see an airplane or hear an airplane I stop to think , " What 's that airplane doing , is it supposed to be there , is it one that I recognize ? " Right , yeah , that 's what these -- these people were saying over here . And , where I live , I live in a no fly zone so , um , that 's a good thing but now with the war going on , I heard a couple of planes , I 'm like wait a minute , " Was that a plane flying over ? Why are they flying over here ? " , you know , and you start getting concerned but , you know , it 's just that I guess they went a different way and that was it .
CT	-- the big tourist attractions . Oh , yeah . Did they close down Disney -- Ah , no . I do n't -- -- you know , for a few days or anything , or -- I do n't believe so . Oh , uh-huh . But they did keep their eye out . And they even have a lot of security now . Oh . You know , just in case . Uh-huh . Well , what I was concerned that I really -- I even feel this now , that the terrorists in -- in -- how can they really stop them if they want to get in there , and why , why if they had heard about nine -- you know , what was going to happen , why did n't the FBI do something ? I mean , it 's , like , " Oh , yeah ?" , you know . I mean -- Well , to me we have so many targets in the United States it would be hard to pinpoint what was going to happen . Yeah , that 's true . I mean , and who ever would have believed that the Pentagon would have been hit ? Mhm . Mhm . That was a shocker . That 's true . Um , -- And my -- What they thought that , y- you know , was that our first attack for the -- that they had on the -- the twin towers do n't really mean that to - much to me . Uh-huh . They do n't -- I did n't -- but they must mean so much different in other cultures , that this is a towering , um , place that , you know , represents the United States , everything about our culture and everything , and finance and -- but they did n't realise that there were so many other different cultures in that building , you know . Because it did n't just affect New Yorkers , it affected people that were there , ah , from all other countries . Exactly . I mean , I think there was like a hundred and three countries involved , or -- Uh-huh . And that was amazing , even to me . Mhm . To realise that , that that many people worked there . But I 've never been to New York , so I really did n't , y- you know , just -- um , but how big those buildings were , that 's what really hit , y- you know , and I 'm thinking , wow , you know and how many tourists were there to see that , and y- you know , there was a few other people that I knew that was in New York at that time , and -- is it clicky ? Yes . I do n't know what that means . I do n't know either . This is my first call , so I do n't know what hap - you know , I was just surprised today that they even called . I was surprised also today that they called . This is my first one also . Uh-huh . So I guess we 're just supposed to make conversation , and , and keep it going , until --
CT	Mhm . Because without that sense of community it , it 's very difficult , and I think you probably see a lot of that within your own town . Right . Because of the sense of community there -- Yeah , 'cause , I mean -- -- there 's a stronger unity , and , um you can , you can trust and rely on more people that way . Right . So... but like I said , you know , um , I do n't think my life really has changed much since then , um , I mean , I was on a plane going across the country not but , you know , four weeks after September eleventh , so , um , the flight really did n't bother me , because I guess I figured , you know , if it 's my time to go it is -- Mhm . -- and there 's nothing I can do to change that . So , um , -- but , you know , it does , it does remind me that , you know , we 're not guaranteed tomorrow , and so I do have to live my life every single day to the best of my abilities , and , um , you know , I guess , I guess I try to keep a better eye on things that are happening around me , you know , if there 's any suspicious activity then I want to be aware of it and , you know , not , um , not go around , I guess , um , totally absorbed within myself , so... Mm . Yeah . All of the , the -- I mean , I think now that , ah , you know , I -- 'cause I guess a lot of -- a lot of those terrorists that were on the plane , they were n't in the country legally . Right . And , ah , I mean , I think , I think I write my congressman more about , you know , enforcing immigration laws . I think that plays a big role in it too . Very true , very true . You know , and I think , I think a lot of it , I think , as far as the country , like you said , you know , a lot of people are arrogant and they think it ca n't happen to them , but , you know , three thousand -- over three thousand people are learned that , you know , hey , it can happen to you . Right . So , I 'm very -- make the -- the whole country more conscious -- Right . -- of what 's going on . Right . Instead of worrying about their car payment and stuff , you know . Right right . Putting their kids in -- Should I buy the boat or should I not , you know . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm out , should I -- should I buy a boat or buy some plastic and duct tape . Right . Which , you know , let me ask you if I can , you know , have you taken those kind of steps for your family , to buy things that you think would be necessary around your home in case there were a terrorist attack around your area ?
CT	Mhm . -- if it had been in Chicago somewhere . Mhm . And , you know , and it makes you w- and I always wonder , since I do n't live in the downtown sector , I always say , " Well , if these things are gonna happen , they gonna hit buildings downtown -- Mhm . -- first " . You know ? Yeah . Or near the airport . Well , see , May nineteenth we had -- oh , April nineteenth , we had the bombing here . Mhm . In , uh , ninety five . Right . Um , and , um I did n't even think with that I -- I still do n't -- I do n't remember changing my routine , really . Mhm . All that much . Even during that . You know . And it was here . Right . Um , I -- I think I 've just , you know , learned or just , you know , just went on . Yeah . Just went on . I mean , it 's kinda hard to -- to stop your life . Right . And I did n't have anyone , you know , affected by it -- Mhm . -- as far as in the bombing . So that ma - -- Yeah , you did n't know anyone personally either -- Right . -- you know , i- it -- Right . -- makes a difference , I think -- Mhm . -- when you have people -- it 's the same way like , when the war started . I feel sorry for the families that got , you know , have children -- Mhm . -- and especially families that have two children in the war . Right . Right . But when it does n't affect you and your immediate family -- Mhm . -- the only thing you can do is to pray for the -- Right . -- safe return of all the other people . Right . But you just ca n't really stop , you know , I mean , you just ca n't get yourself in a tizzy over -- Mhm . -- and so you -- you 'd be a nervous wreck . Oh yeah , oh yes , yeah . You have to grip yourself and like I tell people , that you just have to trust in God and trust your faith and -- Mhm . -- you know . And all this is -- I feel this really in his hands , you know ? Y - yeah . And a lot of this , I mean , this w- the war , the bombings , you know , they make you think twice about how strong your faith is . Right . How strong , you know , um and I think that 's why , you know , some people are able to go on . Mhm . And just , you know , well , if it happens it happens . Yes , that 's right . You know ? And -- and -- and it 's like for myself , I 'm at that point where , you know , my everyday life I 'm just , you know , if it happens , it happens .
CT	That seems like a long time ! And , you know , also working with the military , I -- I appreciate -- Okay . -- I mean , I appreciate the military to no end . I -- I think that the soldiers are fantastic for what they [inaudible ] and I -- I -- my heart and prayers are with them every second o - of the day , um , to try and protect us . Right . Did , um , do you think nine eleven had anything to do with w- -- or Saddam Hussein has anything to do with nine eleven ? I 'm not sure , to be honest with you . I -- I 'm not , uh , I 've -- well , I 've said , having a child , I have the Disney channel on all the time -- Uh-huh . -- because I do n't want him to see this . Right . He 's too young right now to even comprehend , and he 's also at that age where he 's picking up on things and -- Yeah . -- and I do n't want him to be scared out of his wits . Yeah . He 's too young for that . So , I 'm not really paying attention as much to what 's going on as most people do . Okay . I -- But , um , I try to read the newspaper once in a while when I can -- Yeah . -- or if I 'm online , read what 's going on on MSNBC or something like that . Uh-huh . I know the day nine eleven came -- I work in the , uh , library at our education -- at our local -- -- school district , and so we had , uh , it 's for K. through six , we had grades five and six in there , and it was -- it was terrible for them and yet they -- we felt as a staff that they needed to know what was going on . Of course . And they needed to get the facts straight and be with someone that they trusted . And , um , yeah , I can -- I can -- I 'll never forget that day because we had all these kids cramped into this library and asking us questions and , you know , they 'd go home and see it too but maybe mom and dad would n't be there right away to -- Exactly . -- to see this terrible thing and -- and to answer -- -- some of their questions and stuff . So ... And plus there 's the fact that some of these people 's , uh , kids are n't -- do n't like to a - talk to their parents or the parents are n't available to talk to them about -- Right . -- these things . Sure . So ... but other -- well , like I said previously , um , I just do n't think my life , other than being more aware of things , has really changed . Um , one thing that did change out here is , right after this , or in a day or two , gas prices , you know , tripled and quadrupled .
CT	Right . Now , I do think people have been affected by not maybe having jobs , a lot of people are being laid off . Oh , it 's really -- Yeah , the -- -- socked the airline industry . Tourism and all -- all of those -- Yeah . -- things are way down . Well , I do n't think the economy helps any , either . Yeah . Uh , so we 're -- we 're -- I think we 've all been affected that way , our money 's gone down the tubes . I know . It 's -- it -- but it 's still better than working for a living . Yeah . Yeah , well , I 'd like to think that I could hold onto it a little bit and I hope it goes back up , but it does n't look like it 's going there yet . Well , I -- I do n't -- I do n't know -- I -- I just do n't -- do n't know where this is all gonna end . I know . I do n't think we 've seen the end of it . I think the gas pla - -- is your gas coming down up there ? Gas has always been very high in the north east . But you know what , I -- I live -- because I live four months of the year out of the country and gas is -- what is it , two dollars -- it was ... fifty dollars to fill a Volkswagon tank . Wow . Every time we filled it . Mm . That 's a lot of money . So it 's expensive in South America too ? Yeah . Yeah . Oh . Yeah , uh , very expensive . And I th - -- I -- I do n't think this is -- this is -- this is just local , I think this is the whole world . Mhm . I think . And I do n't think we 've seen the end of -- of -- of , um , terrorism . I do n't care how many wars we win or not win , fight or not fight -- We never know . -- um , I -- I think that there 's always gonna be some crazies out there . Well , that 's true . And that scares me . That does scare me . Do you get to New York very often ? I -- New York has started to bore me . You know ? I -- I just do n't -- I do n't have the urge to go to New York . Mhm . Um ... Is there a place to gamble or something in Connecticut ? Oh , lots , it 's the largest ca - -- the largest , uh , casino in the world . Indian ? Yeah , the Indians . Right . Quite a place . I thought I had heard that . Quite a place . Mhm . Yeah . And , uh , I do n't think they have , um , they have had any problems because of terrorists ! Right .
CT	-- not easy , you know ! Yeah . Well , that 's a hard subject to talk about 'cause it 's so vast , um -- Yeah . Yeah , well -- You 're not even -- -- it 's like my life is -- has changed since then , but for different reasons , you know ! Yeah . Yeah . There -- well , there have been a lot of changes . Um , we did n't really know anyone there . Yeah . I mean , we felt for them and it was a tragic thing and -- and we felt horrible about it but directly affecting our lives , it really has n't much . Um -- Yeah . I 'd have to say the same too . Li- like I said -- -- we 're -- we 're diligent about watching what 's going on around us , but other than that there 's really nothing we can do anyway . Um ... you know , you rely on your faith to get you through whatever you 're gonna get through and ... if there 's a smallpox e- -- you know , epidemic , well , okay , you know -- Yeah . -- if we 're supposed to make it through we 're gonna make it through . Yeah . If not , we wo n't . So ... Yep , yeah . It -- kinda have to say of the same attitude . Yeah . Um -- Mostly -- mostly we 're like you , we try and keep the kids , you know , away from the coverage and all that kind of thing . Mhm , definitely . Yeah , that 's a big thing I do n't -- -- watching a lotta that because they just do n't understand and you ca n't -- ca n't explain it to them in a -- in terms they will understand . Yeah . [several inaudible words ] . Yeah . It 's like [inaudible] . Well we -- we do have friends in the military unfortunately and we were kinda worried that he 'd be sent over . Mm . And , uh , and that kinda thing . But , I mean , luckily he was n't , but , um -- -- you -- you just never know . No, you do n't . And -- and had that happened , you know , we would 've said , you know , " Uncle J.C. is going to protect us and take care of us and .. . " and -- Yeah . -- you know , that 's all you can do . But ... Yeah . Um -- You know , you just -- you -- you explain to 'em what you have to but -- Yeah . -- at this age , you know , it 's like , they d- just do n't get it . Yeah . I seen it more with my -- my cousins and that who have kids who are like , seven , eight , you know . Th- -- Mhm . -- they 're really . ' Cause , I mean , I 've -- I 've heard their kids ask some pretty tough questions , and -- and having to field those , and I kinda count my blessings that I do n't have any !
CT	Yeah . You know , yeah , but , um , yes , sports -- they do take -- they will take heavier blows in -- in football and in boxing and , um , wrestling , you know , karate -- karate sports and all that also . And another thing a lot of the , um , professional sports -- I think that it 's , uh , um , hard family life too , you almost need like two homes because -- Mhm . -- like , baseball they come to Florida for spring training and , you know , they 're -- wherever their actual home is and then they 're also all over the country playing these games and it 's like that 's a pretty tough family life . Yes , yes . So , you know , something needs to compensate for that so I guess the pay is about the only thing that can . Right , right . And -- yeah , that 's -- that 's a good -- that 's a good way to -- yes , that 's a good statement because , um , yeah , they would have to , you know , two different homes , you know , 'cause -- 'cause if they have children and they have families , they ca n't just pick up and keep moving -- Well , I saw -- -- every time , you know -- -- one of those , um , those , uh , race car drivers , they have like a mobile home on wheels that they take from track to track with them . Yes , they do , do n't they ? Yeah , they usually have Winnebago . You know -- yeah , that 's -- so that 's the only way they can really maintain a real family life is to take their family on the road with them . And that 's quite the expense there too . Right , that 's true , yes . And then having to hire , um , to hire -- -- people to be with their family , you know -- Mhm . -- such as , um , instructors , home schooling , you know , they have to , um , they have to be compensated for all of that . Because they have -- they seem to have more expenses than a normal , um , blue collar worker . Yes . They would have -- they would have more expenses than they would so , yes , I agree with you on that , you know -- on that . The other thing it really all boils down to , the sports fans are willing to pay the price you know , no matter how much the tickets go to the -- the stadiums are full . Uh-huh . So , obviously the public accepts it . Yes . Now -- ' Cause -- -- I 'm running out of things to think about . Mhm . Well , I can think of something -- -- [inaudible] , okay . Yes , I think , you know , if the sports fans , you know , do , like , um , [inaudible ] and -- and any -- I 'm just not -- I 'm just not a big sports fan --
CT	Right . -- they can change whether they want to or whether they can , it 's the same thing , with , um , with professional , um , athletes of what they get paid compared -- Mhm . -- to what people get paid in the entertainment industry -- Mhm . -- and the bulk of it is -- is just unbelievable amounts of money in comparison to what they expect people to live in , you know , on a minimum wage . Right . You know , which is , you know , not nearly possible on today 's salaries that are n't minimum wage -- Mhm . -- are n't any different to what think were ten , fifteen years ago and I think it 's the same thing when somebody gets in front of a TV or , ah , goes to a movie theatre and sits there and they do n't look at the -- the movie of a television show and say " Hey , look at that actor --" Mhm . "-- you know , they are getting paid X amount of millions of dollars for doing this" , I do n't even think the thought goes through their minds . That 's -- that 's -- They 're aware of it . That 's a valid point . I never thought of it li- you know , because you want to go see Julia Roberts maybe even though she is getting twenty million per movie they are probably , you know , making more than -- than some of the athletes , that is a good point . But -- What -- what burdens me is when they build a new stadium and then they -- like in Denver they built a new stadium and then they tax people . I do n't even live in the Denver county and we have to pay taxes on the stupid new stadium that -- you know , I 'm from California , I do n't even care about these Denver teams , you know so that 's how that , you know , that kind of thing drives me crazy when you do n't even think you 'll , you know , be participating and what is going to go on in that stadium and you are getting taxed for it , I do n't agree with that because these are definitely private teams , it 's not a public Olympic type thing or , you know , I do n't know . And then whose name is on it ? Right . You know , it 's not -- you know , it 's not Denver stadium . Right , exactly . You know , if it was , you know , city , county , some type of government you would -- you would think otherwise -- Mhm . -- so , you know , who is paying for the stadium and the salaries they are getting paid to play in there . Mhm . And then they want the people to pay for where they are playing at inclusive with the salaries that they are receiving -- Yes . -- and the salary that you are receiving is n't even close to it .
CT	You know the Steve Cases and the -- and , you know -- -- and all those guys but , you know , I just -- I just do n't see it -- I ca n't even -- I ca n't even fat- -- you know , in my head imagine that kind of money in a checking account . I -- I think -- I think the country will get tired of them . Because -- you know , and then they do n't just get the salaries , they get all the -- Mhm . -- the perks , the baseball cards -- Mhm , right . -- the -- the shoe , uh , you know -- Mhm . -- contracts . Advertising , yeah . And the commercials . Uh , well if they 'd look around they 'd see that soccer 's a growing , uh -- Soccer ? -- in this country , it 's growing . Yeah , yeah . And , um , eventually people -- Even women , even women . Yeah , mhm . People will get tired of it and , um , it wo n't become so -- as important to 'em and , uh , so ... I -- I do n't understand why they have to be so greedy , to be honest . Mm , but I do know -- I do n't -- I cannot -- That 's all it is , it 's the greed . Yes . I cannot see an actual sports figure holding this country at siege and that 's the way I look at it . Yeah . That they 've got the country by the throat and it 's sort of -- and it sort of , uh , if -- if you do n't , you know , be -- the -- everybody does n't divvy up we 're not doing anything now so ... Right , right . And , uh , it -- it used to be something to everybody that people loved when they played it and , um -- And it used to be really fun to go watch . I do n't -- I do n't like to be threatened and I 'm sure the countr- the companies do n't like to be threatened either . Yeah . Well , the -- you know , the -- the like , " Well , if I do n't get this " um , they throw a tantrum and do n't play . Mhm . And that 's -- and that 's what it looks like -- I 'm sure to a child , you know , I mean how can you cancel the World Series . Right . You know -- Right . -- how can you go on strike and cancel the World Series ? Mhm . It 's -- This is something we watched when , uh , in school even when I was growing up , we watched the World Series and -- Well , sure . -- um , it -- like I said , it -- it 's just not -- it does n't seem to be all that important to anybody anymore to -- unless lots and lots of things . Well , it 's -- it 's -- that 's all the importance is the money . It 's not the game .
CT	The Bears fans seem to be diehard . It -- it 's an all or nothing thing . They do n't -- they do n't fade away when their team fades away , you know ? [inaudible ] that 's good . Um , and of course then my son he 's into soccer and bowling both . So -- Mhm . -- that 's , um -- You gotta -- you got that vibe going through your household . So -- -- you 're exposed to it , yeah . Yes , I 'm exposed . And I 've learned to diligently sit through a -- a Bears game while it was on . Sure . Well , that 's very unique [several inaudible words ] . Uh , yeah , well , you know , I -- I think , uh , you know , uh , as -- as far as the strike it 's , uh -- th - the thing -- I think the thing that most people look at is they -- they -- they ca n't get out of their head that it 's a game , they 're the -- they 're being played -- paid to play a game , which , yeah , you know , it 's not the most important -- it 's not -- it 's definitely not the most important thing in the world , there 's -- there 's , you know , a million other things that are way more worthwhile . Um , I 'm not going to argue with anybody about that , um , but , you know , I -- I think that it basically comes down to i- -- if the money 's not there they would n't be getting it . Um , you know , i- i- i- -- a lot of people think it 's just like , you know , i- the -- the price of a -- of a ticket to get into the arena is what pays for these salaries , but , um , you know , that 's like -- that 's the tip of the iceberg . There is so much money they get from -- from television and broadcast rights , there 's merchandising money , there 's -- there 's all this other stuff and , you know , why should the owners have , you know , even most of it ? Maybe they should have most of it , but why should n't the players get , uh , you know , a share of that ? Yeah . I guess it 's the same as the royalties from the movies or a book . Yeah . Then the other thing is with , uh -- i- i- it 's kinda with actors and actresses too , but also the athletes when you think about it , when -- you 've probably seen this -- I mean , they 'll -- they 'll talk about a guy whose like old when he 's only , like , you know , thirty years old or something like that . He 's , like , he 's a veteran , he 's almost done with his career . Well then , Michael Jordan 's over the hill ! Exactly . I mean , he 's , like , what , he 's thirty eight ? I mean , you know , give -- He 's -- no , he turns forty this year I think . He turns forty , yeah . But , I mean , think about it . I mean , you know , fine , for an athlete that 's over the hill but , I mean , for real life ? What about ... ?
CT	-- it 's just -- I do n't know . I -- I think a lot of the time -- I do n't know if they come up from homes where they really did n't have much and -- They 're kind of over-reacting ? Yeah . That could be . And also they do n't know how to use it . That 's true . And how to handle it because they did n't have it . They do n't do the investing and stuff . Right . ' Cause I think ... Okay . This is mean of me . But I think with like , the NBA , the basketball guys and stuff -- Mhm . -- a lot of them I do n't think do the hi- -- you know , they do n't get their degrees and stuff . Mhm . They go straight in , you know , to basketball , uh , professionally . Really ? So , they -- they have no other education . Oh , that 's too bad ! Yeah . I mean , I heard -- you know , I 'm sure you 've heard it too , that they just kinda get pushed through school -- Uh-huh . -- and , uh , they end up graduating when really they s - should n't . They did n't work it . Yeah . You know ? They did n't learn it . Right . So , you know , I just ... I think the NBA is -- NBA and the baseball are like the worst as far as I 'm concerned . Yeah . Yeah . Well , it 's -- it 's just a big game , like , you know , a big fraud , I mean , just a scam -- Yeah . -- sort of really . But ... Very much so . And they just , you know , they end up making it so that , you know , real people just ca n't make it to the -- the , uh , games and stuff because with their salaries and stuff I think they just are increasing everything so much 'cause they have to make up for it somewhere . Right . And we end up paying for it . Oh , yeah . Right . If -- if we decide to go and watch the game . Right . We pay for it , yeah . So ... Well , even -- as my husband said , uh , " If you buy anything that 's , um , being advertised in between , on commercials --" Oh , yes . Right . "-- you 're also supporting them too " . Yeah , that 's true . You are . Yeah . Ah . But we do n't do that much TV buying . So ... Yeah . I do n't either . So , that 's a good thing . Yeah . Yeah . So , do you have kids that do sports ? Um , actually , mine are very little . They are -- Are they ? Yeah . I 've got one that 's almost eight , and a five and a two year old . Oh , my ! Just got a --
CT	But ... Uh , so you said you traveled -- you traveled , uh , one time with your family ? Yeah . Uh , since the new things have been in place ? Yeah . We came from -- from Nebraska down here to Oklahoma when we were still living up there , to visit some relatives . Oh , okay . Yeah . And , uh , we got laid over and we were there at like , four thirty in the morning to catch the next flight and we -- we were in -- in bad shape . Oh , goodness . And they were taking the +kids ' shoes off ? Yeah . They had us take us her shoes off and checked her clothes and everything . Oh ! It was just -- it was unreal 'cause she was only like , a year and a half , a year and a half I think . So ... Wow ! Yeah . I think we looked pitiful though . Yeah . I mean , every time I tr- go traveling , uh , with my girlfriend she gets -- they make her take her shoes off . I know ! Man ... And she 's , like , you know , the most harmless looking young lady you would ever see . Yeah . I mean , they had people , like , taking foot slops and -- and sandals and obvious , you know , pieces of -- of clothing and stuff off , which just cracked me up . But I think they have a certain amount of people that they have to pull out of line no matter what . Right . In fact , they -- they have to follow some certain ratios . I think they even do it , uh , I 'm not sure , but I think they even some sort of a , uh , random way of determining , you know , like -- Yes . Yeah . -- one -- one out -- out of two or something get searched . Well , I -- I also know that , um , if for some reason your flight has n't been able to go and you have to get a different flight , I think they said everybody that -- that 's on that -- that new flight , the rescheduled flight , has to be checked . Oh , really ? Yeah . Mm . So , I mean , we were there overnight , you know , two hours sleep and they were checking everybody , and you should 've heard all the -- the people that were mad . Oh , I bet , yeah . But , I mean , I -- A lot of them would 've been frustrated . You understand why they 're doing it . It 's frustrating even though -- I mean , there 's no intention -- -- you understand that the intention 's there to keep -- you know , to keep us safe . But ... So , you 're from -- you 're originally from Nebraska , but you 're not living in Oklahoma ?
CT	I 'm a little on the shy side . I do n't [inaudible ] conversations . Oh , okay . I -- I -- I talk to rocks and everybody else -- -- that does but , um , you know , this -- this -- this is funny 'cause a friend of mine sent me this email about this thing at work on Friday . Mhm . And I was n't sure I even did the on line registration thing correctly given that I was multi frittering at the time . When but when I looked at my caller ID when I got home on Saturday , I think they had already attempted seven calls . Wow . I know . I have a feeling the computer is off there saying , " I 'm feckless and unreliable " . Did you stay on topic with your other conversations ? Um , mostly . Mostly . Okay , I 'll get back to airport security . Um , Yep. The boyfriend is trying to embarrass me while I 'm on the phone with you . Um , okay , um , I do n't think they actually want to do voice recognition of a woman giggling . Or any other kind of thing . Um , I also -- my brother in law -- Mhm . -- he 's another one who they used to , this is before being terribly concerned about terrorism , they actually sliced open his brief case . He had -- Wow . -- the look of a drug dealer about him apparently and he would get pulled over going through customs every time , you know . He had that look . He had that look , too much gold jewellery I think . Mhm . but something he did n't believe in as a concept . The thing that really got me , though , is that I actually did know somebody who was smuggling . Mhm . Who never , ever got stopped , hey , and he actually -- he 's , um , he used to travel on business also and the handle of his brief case would come loose . Mhm . And if he had to go , like , to Korea -- Mhm . He would smuggle precious gems in the handle of his brief case . In the handle ? Yeah . There 's like a -- a leather wrap around the handle of the brief case . Does that make sense ? Yeah . Yeah . Wow , that 's ingenious I guess . Hm , sleazy is the word I prefer but probably 'cause I 'm just not too keen on him as opposed to the propential- not +potential -- potential drug dealer who 's really quite a lovely guy . Hm , I would assume so . Like , I 'm going to try to get -- I 'm trying to get back on topic . I 'm trying to think about all the security . It makes me nervous . What about the guns in the -- in the cockpit ? What do you think of that ?
CT	-- I 'm -- I 'm not afr- afraid of it and -- I do n't know , it -- it has n't really changed my view about flying , other than -- well , y- I do n't know , you know , I -- -- since I have n't -- -- done it , maybe it will . Hm . I -- I 'm planning a trip in -- -- in June , so we 'll -- Where are you going ? -- see how it goes . We 're actually going to Europe , so -- Europe , that sounds great . Yeah . Sounds like lots of fun . Looking forward to it . Now , if , uh , if terrorists wanted to do some sort of air thing outside of America , I 'd say that they 'd have just as easily , uh -- easy free range as anywhere else , but , uh , the , uh , -- I 'm not sure how the attacks in America are gonna , uh , keep up right now since we 're attacking most of the countries that the terrorists are coming from and all their funding is being freezed and they 'll have a really hard time getting over here since we 're in a , uh -- we 're geared up for war , um -- Yeah , that 's what I was thinking too . I do n't know who would even attempt it , or who has the money unless it was somewhere like South Korea , or something . Right , and , uh -- Someone we were n't paying much attention to . Right , -- -- right , um , I -- I don- -- I do n't think that there 's , uh , there 's much of a threat , however , I guess my concurrence would be , uh , it can still happen if they 're devoted enough and if he 's -- you know , I 'm wondering about how many , uh , how many more terrorists we 're gonna have because of this war . I mean , how many of these , uh -- how many young boys are gonna remember that their fathers were taken away by these bombs , and , uh -- by a US bomb and grow up and be a terrorist ? And , uh , I mean , I -- I ca n't tell you how big the families are , I do n't know , but when you cut the head of a , uh , hydra off and you 're gonna get more coming back and I 'm not sure that we can solve it by just killing them and carpet bombing them and -- I mean , the ones that were innocent before and came from nice families will grow up now with kids with militant hatred for the US -- Mhm . -- and we just -- just spawned a huge group of future terrorists with this war and our bombing of Iraq . Yeah , I have n't -- I have n't been a supporter of any of our actions thus far and I continue to actively protest against it , but I have n't been watching the news in the last month , so I do n't even know what 's happening now .
CT	-- they -- it 's just unreal the way they live . When I was in Egypt , um , well they were Muslim , you know -- Mhm . -- they are too and -- but it 's a very backwards , you know , society . I mean , you know , they just -- they still , you know , ride donkeys and carry -- Yeah . When I was there it was like , uh -- I really was reminded of , um , bible school and Sunday School when I was a child -- Mhm . -- you know , and all the pictures and the -- and the books , uh , that showed the , um , donkeys and , you know , the women carrying the food on their heads and all that -- that -- and it was really like that and the people lived in caves . I mean , I was amazed but that 's the way -- that 's the way -- Huh , well -- -- they lived and , uh , you know , dirt roads , sand . So , I was , you know , things have advanced but , um , I think if they believe in -- believed in Saddam Hussein -- although I do n't think they r- -- that many of 'em did . I think they did because they had to because he -- Mhm . -- was a dictator . I 'm -- I just hope , you know , that 's all anybody can do , is just hope that , um , you know , that they can live together like -- like we do and , you know , with the different divisions in the religions -- Mhm . It 's like they would have one basic belief . I mean , they all believe in Allah . Yeah , true . Um , but yeah -- it 's like , you know , in England , uh , I never have understood all the conflict there but it 's still -- there still is some between the Catholics and the Protestants . Yeah , that 's very true . And -- and they 're certainly , I would think , you know , people that are educated and know better , but -- Right . I think the United States is just more , um -- we 're a more sophisticated society and , um -- I mean , I do n't think there 's anything wrong with that . Like I think in order for the world to go around you need some societies that are a little bit more advanced than others , you know -- Yeah , right . -- kinda like give and take and that 's what makes the world go around . I just do n't understand like what the outcome is gonna be of this war . Like I understand what -- why they 're going there , but I do n't really see it happening , you know . I just think we 're kinda like blindly going in and targeting a man just because he 's the easiest target right now . Oh , I do n't think that . I think , you know , how many -- eight hundred thousand people he killed ? Uh , I think we 're -- I -- I do n't understand why he would n't cooperate with the , um , UN. I do n't -- I do n't understand that . It 's almost like he has a death wish or something . Or maybe he was just gonna dare us , you know , and did n't --
CT	Yeah , and the other thing that I was a little worried about is , like , we went into this war without any sanctions or -- or any support whatsoever except for -- for Britain . Right . And -- and we did what we wanted to . Do you think , like , the other countries like France and Russia and Germany , they 're -- there 's gonna somehow keep this in their heads later on and -- and either unite against us or just have this fear of us for the rest of , I do n't know , however the United Nations long they may last ? Well , I think that now we tend to kind of think well why are we even a member of the United Nations if they 're not gonna ever back us up or help us , you know , they were so against it . Yeah . I do n't know . Then on the other hand you think well maybe we should have waited longer and listened more to what they had to say because they obviously did n't think that there was enough reason to go forward with the war . Right . So we went to war without their approval . Right . Did -- I do n't know how , as far as it works , getting the -- the support of the general people in America , does he have to -- -- he has to -- did he go to war even without support of Congress ? Oh , I think that they were behind him , I 'm not sure though . Right . Because I did n't really start paying that much attention until we were actually at war because I just thought , " Oh , they 're just talking about it but we wo n't really do it " . That 's what I kept thinking . Yeah . Then I was kinda surprised when we did start , you know . I just feel that , like , a lot of -- we have -- we can -- we can go ahead and -- and run into any country that we feel is a threat , like , um , Afghanistan or -- or Iraq and -- and pull the strings however we want , whether it 's , like , covertly or whether we declare an all right -- all out war , and I think that we 're just -- we 're just gaining so many enemies from doing this , not acting diplomatically and just thinking that because we are a world power we can -- we can do whatever we want . Right . Yeah , I agree with that . Well , now they 've been talking about Syria , that maybe we would end up going into Syria because they think -- Really ? -- that they might be harboring some of those people that we 're after , you know , that escaped from Iraq , that they might be hiding out in Syria and if they they 're protecting them then we -- then , you know , then what will we do , and -- Wow . And it could get to be another mess .
CT	Right , right . Once that structure gets into place . Yeah . Right , right , I agree . And they have got some kind of system set up , something , you know , it does n't have to be modeled after us by any means . Mhm . But some kind of a system set up . Yeah . That , you know , they could , um , get them back on their feet . [inaudible ] Ahah , I agree . So -- so , anyway ... Yeah . It would be nice for it to be over and have everybody back home . Well , that -- that will be a blessing . You know , I 'm just -- I 'm just -- now -- now the main thing is worrying about what do you think is going to happen afterwards as far as the United States , people are worried about terrorism here increasing , what do you think 's gonna happen ? I do n't know , I -- I heard that they , ah , arrested somebody in Detroit . Right . I do n't know . Um , they had some explosives in the back of a car and they were looking at a bridge . Right . And I think , man , I do n't know . I feel like it 's never gonna be the same again . No. Like there 's always gonna be , you know , -- Something . -- suspicion and stuff going on in the background . Right , right . So . Where are you from ? Me , I 'm originally from New York , I live in Philadelphia right now . Oh , okay , I 'm in In- Indiana . In Indiana ? Yeah . Never been there . Have you ever been to New York ? Um , once or twice I think . Oh , okay . Yeah -- Yeah , I 'm originally from New York . I have been here about six years . Oh , right . Yeah , been in Philadelphia about six years , which I hate . [several inaudible words ] Oh . I have -- I have never been there . Um , I 'm trying to think what the other questions were they asked . It was all about the Middle East stuff . Right , right , right . Like if we ever think there will be peace . I think that was the other one . What do you think ? I -- I do n't know . It 's -- it 's so volatile . I think that , um , -- I 'm not trying to put down Islam but they just seem so -- Volatile . Yeah , and mil-, you know , so militant in their views , you know and -- Right , I agree , I agree . And I think -- I think it 's gonna be hard -- I agree . -- when they always think they need to squash the enemy and ... Mhm . Do you know what I -- Do you have religious beliefs ? What ? You , do you have religious beliefs ? Do I what ?
NW	UNC-Chapel Hill has been dubbed the best education value in the land among U.S. public , four-year universities by a financial magazine . The ranking , released today by Kiplinger 's Personal Finance , means UNC-CH has remained at the top position since the magazine started the ranking in 1998 -- even though tuition and fees have more than doubled for in-state students during the same period . Still , Kiplinger 's says , UNC-CH offers " the best combination of high-quality academics and affordable costs . " Other North Carolina public universities on the list were N.C . State University ( 28 ) , UNC-Wilmington ( 32 ) , Appalachian State University ( 33 ) and UNC-Asheville ( 50 ) . The magazine considered indicators of academic quality , including SAT scores and graduation rates . Then it ranked each school based on cost and financial aid . This year at UNC-CH , North Carolinians pay about $ 4,600 in tuition and fees , and out-of-state students pay $ 18,400 . Room and board add about $ 7,000 . Nationally , in-state students at four-year , public universities spend an average of $ 5,491 for tuition and fees , and $ 12,127 in all , counting room and board , according to the College Board . UNC system students likely will pay more in the next academic year . The system governing board will consider tuition and fee increases in the next two months . UNC-CH Chancellor James Moeser said Monday that the university 's financial-aid policies have helped lessen the blow of tuition increases . " Tuition notwithstanding , we 've made it more affordable than three or even five years ago , " Moeser said . In 2004 , the university started the Carolina Covenant , which guarantees a free education to the poorest students , who agree to work on campus as much as 12 hours a week . The covenant program covered about 10 percent of the freshman class this year . Last year , the university introduced new merit scholarships to help recruit talented students . And in recent years , the legislature has set money aside for financially needy students in the UNC system . 'GATED' COMMUNITIES Still , some critics say UNC-CH is increasingly elite . Tom Mortenson , an independent analyst of higher education policy , put UNC-CH at 19th on his recent ranking of 50 public universities that he calls "gated communities of higher education . " NCSU was 31st on that list . He cited the fact that 14.5 percent of undergraduates at UNC-CH in 2003-2004 received Pell Grants , federal financial aid for poor students . " From my perspective , this is an extremely exclusive , publicly financed gated community , and I think it 's an inappropriate role for a state flagship university to play , " said Mortenson , a senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education . Because of UNC-CH 's competitive admissions standards , it is generally attended by students who are born into affluence , Mortenson said . That means that taxpayers end up subsidizing the education of students who would go to college anyway , he added . North Carolina 's private universities made Mortenson 's list of 50 private "gated communities , " with Davidson College seventh , Wake Forest University 12th , Elon University 27th , and Duke University 46th . Davidson officials took issue with the ranking , which identified 7.2 percent of students as Pell Grant recipients . " That is so skewed , " said Kathleen Stevenson , senior associate dean of admission and financial aid . " That sort of thing is only one measure of affordability . " Stevenson said one-third of Davidson students receive financial aid . This year , Davidson 's tuition is about $ 28,600 . Room and board bring the total cost to about $ 36,800 .
NW	Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito told senators Monday that a judge 's obligation is solely to the rule of law , but the lawmakers signaled that fresh policy controversies and partisan views will be elements of his confirmation hearings . " In every single case , the judge has to do what the law requires , " Alito said in an 11-minute statement on the opening day of the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee . The 55-year-old conservative federal appeals judge , who is President Bush 's choice to succeed retiring centrist Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , said good judges develop habits such as delaying their conclusions until everything has been considered . " Good judges are always open to the possibility of changing their minds , " he said . He drew a distinction between his job as a judge and his days as a government lawyer in the Reagan administration , when he offered opinions such as that the Constitution guarantees no right to abortion . " The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desirable result for the client in the particular case at hand . But a judge ca n't think that way , " Alito said . " A judge ca n't have any agenda , a judge ca n't have any preferred outcome in any particular case and a judge certainly does n't have a client . " Alito , who served as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey and has spent the past 15 years on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , also said judges must treat all parties equally . " No person in this country , no matter how high or powerful , is above the law , " he said , " and no person in this country is beneath the law . " The committee of 10 Republicans and eight Democrats begins its first round of questioning today . Its vote is tentatively scheduled for next week , with the Republican-dominated Senate deciding Alito 's fate later this month . Senators ' opening statements Monday largely broke along party lines , with Democrats challenging Alito to defend his positions on the key issues of abortion rights , presidential powers , voting rights and privacy . Republicans urged Alito to refrain from discussing any issue likely to come before the high court . Abortion is expected to take center stage in the hearings because of Alito 's professional writings . As an attorney in the Justice Department , Alito counseled the Reagan administration to chip away at abortion rights until 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision could be overturned . The right to privacy established in Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 laid the foundation for Roe v. Wade , which legalized abortion nationwide . Alito also is expected to be grilled extensively by Republicans and Democrats on his views on executive branch powers and the court 's role in checking them . The Bush administration is being criticized for authorizing spying on American citizens without getting court warrants . The administration also has used the threat of terrorism in the post-Sept . 11 era as justification for holding hundreds of detainees , without charges , at a Navy prison camp in Cuba and for advocating the right to torture terror suspects . Alito has expressed support for a strong executive branch and has written about the " supremacy " of the executive and legislative branches over the judicial branch . " In an era when the White House is abusing power , is excusing and authorizing torture , and is spying on American citizens , I find Judge Alito 's support for an all-powerful executive branch to be genuinely troubling , " Sen. Edward Kennedy , D-Mass. , said at the hearings . " Ultimately , the courts will make the final judgment whether the White House has gone too far . " Sen. Russ Feingold , D-Wis. , said the country needs judges who will " stand up and tell the executive branch it is wrong when it ignores or distorts the laws passed by Congress " and defend constitutional rights and freedoms "even when the president of the United States is telling the country that he should be able to decide unilaterally how far those freedoms go . " Republicans said Alito could bring clarity and common sense to the high court . " I do n't expect to agree with every case you decide , " said Sen. Mike DeWine , R-Ohio , " but your modest approach to judging seems to bode well for our democracy . " Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , complained that liberal groups opposing Alito 's nomination are doing so because the judge wo n't support their political agenda . " And the reason they oppose you is precisely why I support you , " he said . " I want judges on the Supreme Court who will not use their position to impose a political agenda on the American people . " After eating breakfast with Bush at the White House , Alito and his wife , Martha , son Philip and daughter Laura , as well as his sister and several other relatives , listened to the senators ' remarks before Alito took center stage . In contrast to the easy manner and polished delivery of Chief Justice John Roberts during his confirmation hearings last fall , nervousness showed in the bookish Alito 's presentation . But he took his time composing himself , then took a slow drink of water before beginning his brief remarks with a joke about a lawyer arguing his first case before the Supreme Court . When one of the justices asked the lawyer , " How did you get here ? " -- meaning how had his case made it to the high court -- Alito said the nervous lawyer replied , " I came here on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . " " This story has come to my mind in recent weeks because I have often asked myself , How in the world did I get here ? " Alito said . The judge cited the influences of his teacher mother and Italian immigrant father . He said committee members and staffers have his sympathy because they had to review hundreds of his court opinions , which he said "may have constituted cruel and unusual punishment . " Bush nominated Alito after an earlier choice for the O'Connor seat , White House counsel Harriet Miers , withdrew in the face of criticism about her lack of judicial experience and pressure from conservative groups hoping for a nominee with a clear conservative record .
NW	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , speaking through lips swollen from a motorcycle accident a day earlier , announced Monday that the budget plan he 'll unveil today will include $ 72.2 million to increase enrollment in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs . The governor said the money would be part of a $ 1.2 billion increase in health and human services spending he 'll include in his $ 116 billion budget proposal . " There are more than 400,000 children that are eligible for the Healthy Families program , and they are not enrolled yet , " he said at a clinic for women and children . " This is unacceptable . " He said the money would be spent on increasing public awareness and simplifying the process for enrolling and remaining in the low-cost and no-cost health insurance programs for children from low-income families . Healthcare consumer advocates called the governor 's proposal a "nice first step " but criticized Schwarzenegger for falling short of campaign promises to provide insurance for all the state 's nearly 900,000 uninsured children . " For a governor with big ideas , his health proposals have been fairly small steps , " said Anthony Wright , Health Access executive director . Schwarzenegger said expansion of the program was " something to look into , but let 's first find the 400,000 and make sure that we sign everyone up . " Assemblyman John Laird , D-Santa Cruz and Assembly budget committee chairman , urged the governor to move ahead with expanding the program , saying it would cost less than $ 300 million to provide coverage to all the state 's uninsured children . " For a relatively small amount of money in the budget , we could be taking a big step that would actually provide savings over time , because kids will actually be getting care , " Laird said . Robert Ross , California Endowment president and chief executive officer , said investing in children 's health is just as important to the state 's future as the highways , school buildings and other public works for which the governor proposed spending $ 222 billion over the next decade . " The governor outlined an aggressive and bold vision for addressing the infrastructure needs of this state , " Ross said . " We are of the opinion that health care and investing in health care represents a portion of that infrastructure . " But the governor 's vetoed a measure last year , Assembly Bill 772 , to expand enrollment in public health insurance programs , saying it was financially unworkable . Children 's advocates are part of a coalition preparing petitions to fund children 's insurance and other health programs with an additional $ 2.60-per-pack tobacco tax . Schwarzenegger declined to take a position on their proposal Monday , saying he would wait to see if it qualifies for the ballot . With state revenues on the rise , the governor is expected to unveil a markedly different budget today than the relatively austere spending plans of the last two years . He 's already previewed budget increases of $ 4 billion for education , and he 's expected to propose early repayment of some bonds used to balance the state 's budget in 2004 . But the $ 1.2 billion proposed increase in health and human services spending he announced on Monday represents only about a 4 percent increase in the $ 27 billion being spent this year on those programs , and it includes routine adjustments for inflation in huge programs like Medi-Cal , the state 's insurance for the poor . It 's also $ 800 million less than the increase he proposed for those programs last year . (STORY CAN END HERE ) Advocates for welfare recipients said they 're expecting the governor to propose cuts in social services , including welfare . " We are anticipating bad news in the budget , " said Mike Herald , a Western Center on Law and Poverty attorney . While others fretted about potential cuts , Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press conference Monday to call for spending more on public works than the $ 222 billion the governor proposed . " The governor 's plan does not increase our rate of infrastructure investment , " the Democratic gubernatorial candidate said . " It 's what we were going to do anyway , wrapped in a nice bow in a big package , with a nice soundstage behind it . " Angelides said he would raise taxes on California 's highest earners and " close corporate tax loopholes " to help finance his improvements plan . He noted that Schwarzenegger 's plan includes more than $ 100.8 billion already set aside for public improvements , and the $ 68 billion in bonds the governor proposed over the next two elections is similar to what voters have been willing to spend the past five years . Angelides also criticized the governor 's proposed constitutional amendment , which would limit to 6 percent the ratio between annual debt service and General Fund revenues . He called the amendment a "political gimmick " to make his " conservative base ... feel better about what he 's doing . " Schwarzenegger said he expected an "endless amount of debate " over his proposals but said the "mood " in Sacramento is better this year than last year . " The thing is just not to let politics get in the way and let the election year get in the way , " he said . " The thing is just to get beyond that . "
NW	Today 's question : ( EDITORS : BEGIN ITALS ) There was an article in the newspaper about researchers who had discovered the largest prime number . It 's 9.1million digits long . I 'm sure there is a wonderful scientific reason to discover this . I just ca n't figure out what it is . Why is it important to know this ? ( EDS : END ITALS ) Let 's back up a bit and fill in the details . In December , researchers at Central Missouri State University announced that they had discovered the biggest prime number ever , and it includes 9.1 million digits . It took about nine years using a network of about 700 computers around campus to do this . Now , as you no doubt recall from math class , a prime number is any positive number other than 1 that can be divided only by 1 and itself . For starters , 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 are prime numbers . Personally , I can take prime numbers or leave them alone . But if you are of a certain mathematical bent , prime numbers are pretty hot stuff , and people have been studying them since the time of Euclid and assorted other ancient Greeks . Anyway , why did they go to all that time and effort to find a prime with 9.1 million digits ? There are a few reasons . I found this quote from Steven Boone , one of the researchers involved , in an article from the " Guardian " : " People ask why we do this . It 's like going on a quest . We 're looking for something incredibly rare . " In other words , they kind of did it for the hell of it . Second , there is money involved . An outfit called the Electronic Frontier Foundation has offered a $ 100,000 prize for finding a 10 million-digit prime number . And prime numbers do have their uses , so I suppose the bigger the prime the better . For one thing , prime numbers are used for hash tables . I have no idea what a hash table is and for what I get paid , I 'm not about to look it up . But prime numbers are especially dandy things when you are dealing with computer encryption . That 's what lets you do online banking or order stuff by computer using your credit card . This involves a bunch of math we wo n't go into here , but one thing I read said a computer that could check 1 trillion numbers a second would take about 122 quadrillion ( EDITORS : "quadrillion " IS IN ITALS IN ORIGINAL ) years to exhaust all possibilities involved in breaking a typical 128-bit encryption based on prime numbers . I have no idea if that is really true , but those are some pretty impressive numbers , do n't you think ? ( Reach Clay Thompson at clay .thompson( a )arizonarepublic.com or (602 ) 444-8612.)
NW	a big change in the character of the downtown area . In May 2005 , Anthony Forte and his dog , Philly , moved from his town house in a quiet , residential neighborhood to a loft condo in the heart of Center City . Known as the Jewelers ' Building , one of Philadelphia 's more recognizable buildings , the 106-year-old six-story structure still has much of its original Colonial Revival detailing intact even though it sat empty for years . " The city has been a great place for me to live , but it 's become much more vibrant , " Forte said . " Philly always had its residential areas that are quaint , which some people love . But now downtown is extremely diverse , with lots of residential mixed with restaurants , galleries and high-end retail . My only regret is that I got a new car , because I do n't drive anymore . " Like 37 percent of downtown residents , Forte walks to work , the highest percentage of any major American city , according to census data compiled by the Center City District . Levy , the Center City District 's president , said , " We did n't reinvent downtown living , but in the last five years , it 's been explosive . " By decade 's end , the city expects to add another 7,000 units . Now , the tax-abatement programs have become somewhat controversial . While a small percentage of wealthier residents are living in high-end properties and are paying very little in taxes , a majority of the longtime residents who suffered through the bad years are likely to see their taxes go up as property values rise . Mildred Ruffino has lived on the city 's south side for 32 years , with much of her family close by . The tax-abatement program , which has spurred housing almost exclusively downtown , is now spilling over to other neighborhoods . Ruffino 's street will soon have eight town houses where a bakery once operated . " I realize the economic situation and what the city is trying to do to bring back residents , but it 's exorbitant , " said Ruffino , who works in the accounting department of an architectural firm . " An empty bakery is n't doing anybody any good . But 10 years is a long time to be tax free . " Yet there is no question that tax abatements have had an impact on the city 's real estate and development industry , said Stephen P. Mullin , a senior vice president and principal of the Econsult Corp. , an economic research firm in Philadelphia . " You could n't make money here in Philly building something new five years ago , " Mullin said . " Obviously , low interest rates helped as well . But even with that , you needed the extra bump . Now , instead of property values declining , which they were doing for years , they 're increasing , and everyone benefits from that . " Even though it is difficult to tease out the precise impact of tax abatements on the city 's economic fortunes , they have certainly succeeded as a marketing tool . " Ads in the real estate section prominently feature the tax abatement , " said John Kromer , senior consultant with the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania . " Property taxes in the suburbs have been increasing . So this is one area where the city can
NW	The Pistons may indeed be on a pace to win 70 games , but the man who put this group together , Detroit hoops boss Joe Dumars , says such thinking is ludicrous . " Trying to win 70 games is absolutely nothing we talk about around here , " Dumars said by e-mail . " It 's ridiculous to be talking about winning 70 games . Our only goal here is to try and win the NBA championship and nothing else . " He 's right , of course . Think Tommy Heinsohn would n't trade a few of the 68 wins he led the Celtics to in 1972-73 for the NBA title that eluded them that season ? At the time , the 68 wins matched the second-most in NBA history , behind only the 69-win Lakers team of the year before . But the Celtics went down to the Knicks in seven games in the conference finals , losing Game 7 at Boston Garden . One reason the Celtics did n't make it : John Havlicek injured his shoulder . Dumars has no such worries at present . The Pistons ' vaunted starting five have started every game this season and , dating back to their championship season of 2003-04 , Chauncey Billups , Rip Hamilton , Tayshaun Prince , and Ben Wallace have missed a total of 25 games . Prince has yet to miss a game and Wallace 's eight DNPs last year were the result of a suspension ( six games ) and a death in the family ( two ) .
NW	FOXBOROUGH - The coach wanted to help a talented player , but was n't sure what to do . He was n't too familiar with college football recruiting . So Frank Krevetski produced videotapes of Artrell Hawkins 's career highlights , then planned to ship them across the country . Maybe someone would notice . When he got to the large envelope with the South Bend , Ind. , address , he chuckled . Notre Dame ? " I figured , why not shoot for that ? " recalled Krevetski , who was the coach at Bishop McCort High School in Johnstown , Pa. , in the early 1990s . " I never really coached a lot of players who were Division 1-caliber . We did n't have players like Artrell on a yearly basis . " Notre Dame never called . Krevetski was n't surprised . But one Irish staff member , off to a new career challenge , did n't forget what he saw on that tape . Rick Minter was leaving Notre Dame to become coach at the University of Cincinnati , and he phoned Krevetski , asking if Hawkins had committed to another college . It might have been too late . Hawkins was visiting Wake Forest but if he called home , Krevetski told Minter he 'd put them in touch . Hawkins called . And the course of his future took an unexpected turn . " It all happened kind of fast , " Hawkins said . " I went out there , talked to him the first time , and committed to Cincinnati . Some people thought it was a quick decision and that there were better offers from traditional football schools . But I was comfortable with where I thought the program was going . " Hawkins is now in his eighth NFL season , and much like the unexpected turn he took from Bishop McCort to the University of Cincinnati , he never thought he 'd be suiting up for the New England Patriots in 2005 . And he certainly never thought he 'd be playing safety , instead of his natural cornerback position . Last night , the 29-year-old Hawkins invited Krevetski to Gillette Stadium for a pretty sweet moment in his career . After playing six years with the Bengals ( 1998-2003 ) , one with the Panthers ( 2004 ) , and sustaining a hamstring injury that led the Redskins to release him in training camp this season , Hawkins was appearing in the NFL playoffs for the first time . He wanted Krevetski there because "you always want to remember those who give you opportunities . " Krevetski said he expected to shed a tear when Hawkins first took the field . The bond between player and coach can last a long time . " I 'm just elated inside , " Krevetski said . " You never hear a bad word about Artrell . He comes back to town , he works with the youths and the school , and has no qualms about coming back to speak at coaches ' banquets . He 's always been that way . He 's a very sincere kid . " Mark Duffner , a defensive assistant with the Bengals from 1997-2002 , echoed those words . Duffner was with Hawkins from the start , after the Bengals selected Hawkins in the second round of the 1998 draft . " I really enjoyed Artrell 's persona , the guy he is , " said Duffner , the former Holy Cross coach who spent the last three years as linebackers coach with Green Bay . " He 's the type of guy you enjoy being around , a competitive athlete who is serious about being a good football player and serious about being a good person . He was a first-teamer for us , and also a team-firster . " Signed as a free agent by the Patriots Nov. 15 , Hawkins was elevated to the first team when the Patriots visited the Chiefs Nov. 27 . He was the team 's seventh starter at strong safety , following Rodney Harrison , Guss Scott , James Sanders , Arturo Freeman , Randall Gay , and Michael Stone . Although undersized for the role at 5 feet 10 inches , 190 pounds , and having never played the position , Hawkins 's intelligence and physical style made him the best fit . " That 's why you never give up , you never lose faith , " Hawkins said . " As the saying goes , God works in mysterious ways . At times you think you might understand . When I was with the Redskins , I really wanted to make the ballclub , but then unforeseeable stuff happens . I guess the beauty of it , in this case , is that the opportunity with the New England Patriots came up . It 's the chance of a lifetime . " Coming in at kind of the tail end of the season , I 've gotten my feet wet and learned about my teammates . I had read a lot about them and how professional this team is . After seeing the amount of work and preparation that goes into it , I 'm not surprised at how successful the team is . This year has been tough for me in terms of injuries , but I 'm appreciative Coach [Bill ] Belichick and the organization brought me in . " That 's why Hawkins said he long ago stopped trying to predict the future . When he was a junior in high school , he injured his collarbone and missed all but one game . Yet he still wound up at Cincinnati , the result of a highlight tape initially sent to Notre Dame . While at Cincinnati , Hawkins heard whispers that the program would never compete at a high level . Yet he helped lead the Bearcats to their first bowl appearance since 1950 , at the 1997 Humanitarian Bowl in Boise , Idaho . And perhaps he heard some whispers that after seven seasons he 'd never experience life in the NFL playoffs , especially after a snakebitten 2004 season in Carolina , in which the defending NFC champs suffered numerous injuries . Yet here he is now , in New England , his high school coach watching his every step in the playoffs . " It 's special , " Hawkins said . " When you start playing football , you always knew what the Super Bowl is . It 's always been the dream . Just to get to this point , to have a chance to play for a championship , I feel blessed . "
NW	When USC coach Pete Carroll agreed to a five-year contract extension last week , he said , " I want to see how far we can take this . " Some might argue he found out before serving a day of his new agreement , when USC lost to Texas in the Rose Bowl and fell short in its historic chance for a third straight national title . Without quarterback Matt Leinart , tailback Reggie Bush , offensive tackle Winston Justice and possibly tailback LenDale White , the Trojans suddenly look a lot more normal next season . " Now the question is can you be dominant three out of four years ? " Carroll said , wondering if the Trojans can win a national championship next season . " We 've done this before . I ai n't worried about it . " Maybe not , but right now it 's hard to say who could replace Leinart and Bush , or if it 's even possible . If you listen to the hype , the Trojans lost two of the greatest quarterbacks and tailbacks in college history . As impressive as USC recruits these days , it 's hard to imagine another Bush turning up , and even Bush required time to develop as a freshman , which means next year the Trojans might not be able to just win on sheer athletic ability . Who is going to break off 36- and 45-yard touchdown runs against Notre Dame , like Bush did against the Irish this season ? Those plays did n't get the attention of Leinart 's fourth-and-9 pass to wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett , but they were just as important and prevented the Irish from building momentum . No one on the current roster is even close to Bush 's explosiveness and if White goes pro , tailback becomes a huge question mark . The Trojans go into next year with a committee of Hershel Dennis , Desmond Reed , Chauncey Washington and Michael Coleman at tailback . Additionally , USC will bring in at least three recruits at tailback . Emmanuel Moody ( Coppell , Texas ) committed Saturday , while Stafon Johnson ( Dorsey High of Los Angeles ) and Michael Goodson ( Houston ) are also expected to select USC. The quarterback situation is less muddled but still a question mark . Sophomore John David Booty played in seven games this season , which is far more experience than Leinart got before he started . But will Booty beat out highly regarded freshman Mark Sanchez ? Between the two , Sanchez owns the stronger arm , but Booty 's been in the program three years . Carroll wants to choose a starter in spring practice , like he did with Leinart in 2003 , so everyone knows who the No. 1 quarterback is before training camp . That presents a dilemma : Booty would be a safe choice , but Sanchez possesses more potential . There wo n't be any problems finding someone to throw to , because USC returns starting wide receivers Jarrett and Steve Smith , along with freshman Patrick Turner . The offensive line returns three starters ( Ryan Kalil , Fred Matua , Sam Baker ) although offensive tackle Winston Justice is expected to turn pro . It 's still a pretty good offense , but not the greatest in history , like the 2005 version made a claim for . And it will require a punter . But who ? Tom Malone graduated , and USC only has walk-on Taylor Odegard . No recruits impressed the coaches in the summer , and USC might sign a junior-college punter as a stop-gap measure . The role of freshman kicker Troy Van Blarcom also figures to increase . Carroll said Van Blarcom would have kicked a game-tying field goal against Texas in the closing seconds , even though the freshman did not attempt a field goal all season . But next year , the Trojans are going to need a long-range kicker . Going for it on fourth down inside the 30-yard line wo n't be as easy without Leinart and Bush . The lack of experience at tailback and quarterback puts the burden back on the defense , which will be considerably stronger next season . Linebacker will be the Trojans ' top position , especially at the middle ( Oscar Lua , Rey Maualuga ) and strong side ( Dallas Sartz , Thomas Williams , Brian Cushing ) spots , where five starters return for two positions . It wo n't surprise anyone if Carroll finds a way to get as many of those players on the field as possible . Sartz could play safety , especially if junior Darnell Bing goes pro . That would enable Josh Pinkard to remain at cornerback , although he 's expected to return to his natural safety spot . Terrell Thomas , Kevin Thomas and Cary Harris will be the top candidates at cornerback . The defensive line remains solid , losing only senior Frostee Rucker . Defensive ends Jeff Schweiger and Kyle Moore assume far bigger roles at defensive end and make the Trojans bigger and more athletic . Defensive end Lawrence Jackson , despite being nearly invisible against Texas , will be projected as an All-American candidate next season . But more than names and faces , next year 's USC team also battles expectations . A 37-2 record the past three seasons means no one on the current roster knows what it means to lose three games in a single season . USC opens at Arkansas ( where Coach Houston Nutt no doubt remembers the Trojans throwing play-action touchdown passes with a 63-17 lead ) and the second game is against Alamo Bowl-winner Nebraska . Even Carroll acknowledged it 's tougher to get back to the top than staying there . " I like the burden , I have n't had a problem with the burden , " Carroll said . " Is it harder to stay there or get there ? We 'll find out now , but we did n't have a problem staying there . "
NW	President Bush snubs the rest of the world so completely with his standoffish foreign policy that the international credibility of the United States has been eroded -- for no good reason -- U.S. Rep. Adam Smith , D-Tacoma , charged Saturday . From the time of George Washington , America set itself apart from other countries by treating war prisoners fairly and by urging human and civil rights , Smith said . But those days have disappeared under the Bush administration , he told a crowd of about 300 people gathered for a town hall meeting in Tacoma . " The message is sent to the rest of the world we 're not that shining city on a hill any longer , " he said . " We 're just a bunch of thugs trying to get our own individual advantage . " In a wide-ranging 90-minute session , during which he answered questions from the friendly , predominantly anti-Bush , anti-war audience , Smith also said : -- He originally backed the U.S. invasion of Iraq , but he now believes " the president has shown he 's not worthy " of the faith and trust Congress and the American people put in him . -- He favors a gradual , rather than abrupt , withdrawal from Iraq . " We need to be very respectful for what our troops are doing , regardless of what we think about the war , " he said . -- He believes the " White House attitude and approach toward civil liberties , " as evidenced by recent stories of monitoring the telephone calls of some U.S. citizens without warrants , "is deeply concerning . " Smith , a member of the House Armed Services and International Relations committees , recently returned from his second trip to Iraq . When he was there in 2004 , it was clear to troops on the ground that the administration had a plan for knocking out the regime but no blueprint for was to happen next , Smith said . During a trip at the end of 2005 , he learned that U.S. troops remain committed to their jobs , but they 're tired and want to come home , he added . " It should be the stated policy of the United States that we will have no permanent bases in Iraq , " he said . It 's time to turn the country over to its own people , Smith added . But a complete withdrawal now would be a mistake , he said , because the country needs more stability . " The only real measure of progress over there is when we start getting out , " he said . The five-term congressman wants Congress to investigate what he believes is the administration 's lack of regard for truth about prewar intelligence and support for "unauthorized wiretapping . "
NW	or canceled flights for passengers and significant cost savings for airlines . At Reagan National Airport , the RNP procedure has already proved itself . Since the system 's quiet approval in September , Alaska Airlines -- the only airline certified to use the procedure there -- has used it 10 times to land at the airport on the west bank of the Potomac River , said airline spokeswoman Amanda Tobin . Three of those times , Alaska was able to land successfully when other airlines ' planes were forced to divert to other airports . At Juneau , where the system has been in use the longest , RNP has saved hundreds of flights from diversion , the company said . Throughout Alaska 's system , the airline flies about 6,000 RNP approaches a year , said Kevin Finan , the airline 's vice president of flight operations . That navigation system typically saves the airline about 800 diversions or cancellations a year . In addition , RNP has helped bring customers to their destinations when less-sophisticated instrument landing systems would have been inadequate . For isolated Alaska communities , the RNP system has made connections more reliable even in the inhospitable weather that plagues the 49th state . No straight lines needed With the FAA , the SeaTac-based carrier has developed RNP navigation programs for several other difficult airports , including Palm Springs , Calif. , Sun Valley , Idaho , San Francisco and several smaller Alaska cities . The advantage of the RNP system compared with a conventional Instrument Landing System is that the plane 's path toward the airport does n't have to follow a straight line , said Sarah Dalton , Alaska 's director of airspace and technology . Instead , the RNP path can follow a curving path with irregular altitude changes that are required in some particularly hemmed-in airfields . The RNP approach to Reagan from the north , for instance , follows the meanders of the Potomac River past some of the most recognizable landmarks of the nation 's capital : the Watergate apartments , the Kennedy Center , and the Lincoln Memorial . That path down the river was picked to minimize the noise impacts on such upscale residential areas as Georgetown and Foggy Bottom while keeping the plane clear of security-sensitive offices and landmarks . The RNP system is so precise that the FAA allows planes to land in much worse weather than they would in a conventional instrument landing approach , Finan said . At Reagan , for instance , aircraft using RNP can land when visibility is 1.25 miles and with a ceiling of just under 500 feet . With a conventional approach , the limits would be 2.25 miles visibility and a 750-foot ceiling . FOLLOW THE LEADER Other airlines are following Alaska 's lead . Both JetBlue Airways and American Airlines have applied to use the RNP approach to Reagan . Continental Airlines uses RNP at several airports , including Tel Aviv in Israel . Alaska and the FAA now are developing RNP approaches to more airports that frequently experience weather delays . In this state , Wenatchee is in line for such an approach . Nationwide , the FAA plans to create RNP approaches this year to 25 additional airports , including JFK in New York , Chicago 's boxed-in Midway Airport

NW	BUCKHANNON , W.Va . - They laid the earthly remains of Jesse Jones to rest Sunday in a polished wooden box beneath the rocky soil of Appalachia . " Jesse was and is a coal-mining man , " said the Rev. Donald Butcher . " Jesse 's grandpa on his daddy 's side died in a mine explosion . Coal mining runs deep in the blood of many of our families . " Then , as the preacher comforted Jesse 's widowed mother , Lulu Belle Jones , somebody turned on a CD of Vince Gill singing . " Go rest high on that mountain . Son , your work on Earth is done , " the haunting , disembodied voice rang out . " Go to heaven a-shouting love for the Father and the Son . " There was n't a dry eye in the crowded chapel of the Tomblyn-Whitescarver Funeral Home , located about 10 miles from the Sago coal mine where Jones and 11 of his co-workers perished last week . In several grieving mountain towns , funerals for six dead miners were held Sunday . In addition to Jones , they were Jackie Weaver , Martin Toler Jr. , David Lewis , Alva Bennett and Jerry Groves . Services for the others were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday . " God has 12 new angels , " said the sign at the Go-Mart in Buckhannon . At the entrance to the Sago mine itself , the Associated Press reported that 12 big , black bows were tied to a fence . In nearby Philippi , Weaver , 52 , was buried on a snowy hillside beside the grave of his son , Jackie Jr. , who died in 1982 at the age of 11 in a moped accident . Among the items in the elder Weaver 's casket were a camouflage hunting cap , a homemade " Happy Birthday Daddy " card made of yellow construction paper , and a child 's drawings of a father in a miner 's hard hat . Weaver , who spent 26 years working in the mines , always wrote " Jesus saves " in the coal dust of the cart that took him and other miners into the dark shaft , his cousin , Scotty Felton , told the AP. In the casket of Jesse Jones , 44 , were pictures of his daughters , Sarah and Katelyn , and an embroidered pillow reading " Daddy 's Girl . " Butcher spoke movingly of the hard times that folks in these parts have endured for generations . " My family were coal miners , " he recalled . " When my grandpa was 26 or 27 , he was setting a charge in a coal mine and the explosion blinded him . He never set eyes on me , and he walked with a cane for the rest of his life . " But the preacher said he loved and missed his "paw-paw , " whose disability entitlement from the mining company came to $ 18 a month . " Coal miners are a different breed , " he said . Speaking of Jones , he said , " Here 's a young man , just 44 years old , who spent 21 years , nearly half his life , in a coal mine . God gives us people who are heroes and we do n't even realize it . " Jones was a loving son , father and brother , the preacher said . He liked "hunting , fishing , pitching horseshoes and digging ramps . " Folks do n't appreciate what miners contribute to the country , the preacher said , adding , " America is great because of men like Jesse Jones . " A few "amens " rumbled through the assembly . Butcher read the lyrics from a song titled " A Coal-Mining Man . " " Daylight or dark , rain or shine , " they went . " It do n't matter much , down in the mine . " Meanwhile , doctors treating Randal McCloy Jr. , the only survivor of the ordeal in the mine after an explosion a week ago , hoped to ease his medically induced coma on Sunday , allowing physicians to perform a neurological exam , the AP reported . " It has been very difficult to allow him to awaken , although that is our hope today , " said Dr. Larry Roberts , the head of McCloy 's treatment team at West Virginia University 's Ruby Memorial Hospital . Doctors placed McCloy , 26 , in a coma to give his brain time to heal . McCloy 's wife , Anna , spoke briefly with reporters , asking that Sunday 's attention should focus on those whose lives were to be remembered . " We are thinking of them today and throughout this difficult time , and we ask you to please keep all the families in your thoughts and prayers , " she said .

NW	Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge . In addition to the Xbox 360 , there is an iPod docking station and a cell phone that doubles as a " smart key " to start the engine . In at least one respect , the Urge might be the perfect car : it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing ; it generates no emissions ; it lines up in no traffic jams . It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nuerburgring . Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown , a special thrill for Manhattan drivers . With a wireless connection , in theory , two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City . Thanks to the Internet , the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart . The game encourages stylish driving . Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points , called Kudos , that can be redeemed for a better vehicle . According to the Microsoft programmers , power sliding , pulling off a 360-degree spin , getting air time , drafting and getting up on two wheels " will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill . " Too bad the real automotive world does n't work this way . Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators , who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations . Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield . Oddly , the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen . That will probably be remedied soon . Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded . The Urge 's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented . A similar concept , the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach , Calif . -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall . The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard . The two cars simply evolved at the same time , Cupit said . He prefers his version of the idea . " We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain , and also vehicle ingress-egress , " he said . " Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car , for example . " " We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about , " Cupit said . " The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people . " Observing young people at auto shows , it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go . The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts , rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious .
NW	After poring over Guidant 's confidential financial records for more than a month , Boston Scientific said Sunday that it would make a formal , binding bid worth $ 25 billion in cash and stock for the company . The offer is expected to set off a takeover battle between Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson , which had already agreed to buy Guidant for $ 21.4 billion . Johnson &amp; Johnson lowered its earlier $ 25.4 billion offer because it said a raft of safety problems had diminished Guidant 's value . The board of Guidant , the nation 's second-largest maker of implantable defibrillators and pacemakers after Medtronic , is expected to meet early this week to evaluate the proposal . If Guidant 's board deems Boston Scientific 's bid to be superior , Johnson &amp; Johnson will have five days to respond with a new , higher offer . Investors and analysts have been waiting anxiously to see if Boston Scientific would be comfortable enough to continue to pursue its bid after reviewing Guidant 's internal financial and safety records , especially after it was disclosed last month that the Food and Drug Administration had new reports about patient deaths associated with short circuits in Guidant 's heart devices . In an interview Sunday , James R. Tobin , Boston Scientific 's chief executive , said he was satisfied with what he saw at Guidant . " We did very thorough due diligence , " Tobin said . " We put a full-court press on this thing . The Guidant folks were very open to us . Clearly they have some short-term challenges . We 're realistic about what we 're dealing with here . " Tobin added that beyond studying Guidant 's own records , Boston Scientific also talked to doctors and others involved in health care to gauge the vitality of the business . " There are clearly trust issues that have developed , " Tobin said . " On the other hand , Guidant 's technology is acknowledged to be right up there . And we think there 's an opportunity to regain that trust . " As part of Boston Scientific 's formal offer , the company said that it had reached an agreement to sell two Guidant units , its vascular intervention and endovascular businesses , to Abbott Laboratories for $ 3.8 billion to satisfy regulators if it reaches a merger agreement with Guidant . Boston Scientific also said that its offer -- $ 36 a share in cash and the equivalent of $ 36 a share in stock -- would include what is known in the business as a collar , to protect investors should Boston Scientific shares fall and to protect Boston Scientific from paying too much if its own shares jump . Under the terms of its offer , Boston Scientific said that if the average closing price of its stock in a 20-day period before the Guidant board 's approval of the deal is less than $ 23.62 , Guidant shareholders will receive 1.5241 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant stock . If the average price is greater than $ 28.86 , Guidant shareholders will receive 1.2474 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant stock . Boston Scientific 's offer represents about a 12 percent premium over Johnson &amp; Johnson 's offer , based on the closing price of Johnson &amp; Johnson 's shares on Friday . Boston Scientific said it estimated that if a deal was consummated , the combined company would have $ 10 billion in sales in 2007 . It expects the combined company 's sales to grow at a double-digit rate , achieving $ 16 billion in 2011 . Boston Scientific 's side deal with Abbott is aimed at helping complete the deal quickly , but it also has big implications for Abbott and the industry . The side deal is likely to be criticized by Medtronic . The company had unsuccessfully opposed Johnson &amp; Johnson 's plans in its proposed merger with Guidant to license Abbott to use Guidant 's delivery gear for stents , which are used to open blocked blood vessels . Medtronic had argued that it was better positioned than Abbott to use the technology to provide added competition . Medtronic is likely to make similar arguments to regulators that Boston Scientific should be forced to give it access to Guidant 's technology . Abbott has been developing its own stent products . Last year , it became the second company after Guidant to gain regulatory clearance to market stents to prop open the carotid arteries , which are the main pathway for blood to the brain . But Abbott 's effort to compete in the multibillion-dollar market for drug-coated coronary stents has lagged far behind those of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Boston Scientific , the market leaders . The acquisition of Guidant 's vascular business would represent the company 's first major commitment to what had been a relatively cautious strategy of diversifying into device implants , which is dominated by companies like Medtronic , Johnson &amp; Johnson and Boston Scientific . Abbott acquired two startup vascular companies , Jomed and Integrated Vascular Systems , in 2003 .
NW	meeting , and in televised remarks at the start , pledged continuity with Sharon 's policies . Sitting next to Sharon 's vacant chair , the largest of those at the Cabinet table , Olmert , using Sharon 's nickname , pledged " to continue to do what Arik would want -- running affairs as they should be . " Olmert said , " We are hoping and wishing that the prime minister will recover , strengthen and return to presiding over the Israeli government and leading the state of Israel . " He said later , " I pray with all the people of Israel that my tenure as the acting prime minister will be short . " But it is likely to last at least until the March 28 elections . Shimon Peres , the former Labor Party prime minister who joined Sharon and Olmert in the new Kadima Party , said Sunday that he expected Olmert to lead the party into the elections . Peres , 82 , said on CNN that he was interested in returning as a member of the legislature on the Kadima list , but that he did not intend to compete with Olmert to become prime minister . " I want to devote whatever time and energy I have for the peace process , " he said . (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. ) There had been reports in the Israeli media that Peres was thinking of abandoning Kadima and returning to the Labor Party and that he had asked Olmert for the job of foreign minister if the current Likud Cabinet ministers go through with a plan to quit the government for the election campaign . Israelis are accustomed to news happening quickly and have become experts in living the motto "life goes on . " The debris from terror attacks -- the dead and wounded , pools of blood , shattered glass -- is usually cleaned up in a matter of hours . Traffic quickly resumes on the same streets where buses have been blown up , and shoppers continue to pick through merchandise at one end of an open-air market while police officers at the other end continue to sift for forensic clues left by a suicide bomber 's explosion . Andrea Miller , 23 , who was born in Utah and who performs with one of Israel 's best dance companies , said she was surprised by how Israelis had been put in a holding position over Sharon 's illness . A decision to go ahead with a performance on Thursday was made only at the last minute , and she and the other dancers in her company were put on notice that this week 's performance schedule would be linked to Sharon 's health . " People are much more concerned about respecting a mourning period " here than she thought Americans would be in a similar situation , she said . Yaron Kadosh , 25 , who works at a sandwich bar on Ben-Gurion Boulevard , disagreed . Israelis were already bouncing back from the news of Sharon 's collapse , he said . " Everyone went into shock with the news that Sharon appeared to be dying , " he said , " but after a few days people were already moving on and focusing on who will come next . "
NW	President Bashar Assad of Syria rushed to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for a surprise meeting with Saudi leaders . The meeting occurred a day after he was quoted as saying that he would not cooperate with the U.N. investigation of the assassination of Rafik Hariri , the former Lebanese prime minister . Within hours of a meeting in Damascus , Syria , with the Saudi foreign minister , Prince Saud al-Faisal , Assad flew to Jiddah , Saudi Arabia . There , he joined a meeting and banquet with top members of the Saudi ruling family , including King Abdullah ; Prince Naif , the interior minister ; Prince Miqren , the chief of general intelligence ; and Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the secretary general of the National Security Council , the government-run Saudi Press Agency reported . In wording clearly meant to encourage Assad to cooperate , the royal family released a statement saying that at the meeting , Abdullah "affirmed the kingdom 's desire for stronger relations between Syria and Lebanon in all fields , so that the interests of both countries and security of the region are protected . " It is not the first time that Saudi Arabia has prodded Syria to ease relations with Lebanon and the United Nations . In March , Assad went to Riyadh seeking support for his determination to keep Syrian troops in Lebanon , but he was bluntly rebuffed by Abdullah , who was then crown prince . In November , the Saudis brokered a deal in which Syria allowed some government officials to meet with U.N. investigators . On Tuesday , Abdullah also met with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to seek ways to resolve the standoff that has gone on for months , Reuters reported . Last month , the U.N. investigation into the truck bombing that killed Hariri and 20 others in February 2005 concluded in a preliminary report that the attack was the work of high-level Syrian and Lebanese intelligence officers . Syria has repeatedly denied involvement , and more recently has sought to discredit witnesses and raise doubts about the evidence presented . International pressure on Syria has increased recently , especially after a former Syrian vice president , Abdel-Halim Khaddam , went public last month with his accusations that Assad and other Syrian officials had directly threatened Hariri in the months before he was killed by a truck bomb . Last week , U.N. investigators asked to directly interview Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in the killing . In an interview published Saturday in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Osboa , Assad was quoted as saying that he intended to reject the request , citing presidential immunity .
NW	Though Alito 's decision in Casey was careful , technical and reflected an effort to interpret the Supreme Court 's confusing abortion jurisprudence at the time , the fact that he found himself on the losing side of the most important abortion case since Roe will doubtless prompt many questions . So , too , will a statement Alito made in a 1985 job application for a position in the Justice Department . He said he was proud to have helped advance "legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly . " One of those positions , he said , was that " the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion . " While Roberts was one of nine government lawyers who signed a brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe , he said that positions he took as an advocate were not necessarily his own . Alito may find it harder to distance himself , should he wish to , from his Casey dissent and his personal statement in 1985 . PRESIDENTIAL POWER Specter , in prepared remarks to be presented Monday , said , " This hearing comes at a time of great national concern about the balance between civil rights and the president 's national security authority , " a reference to the domestic surveillance program . There is , he said , an apparent conflict between " the president 's constitutional war powers as commander in chief to conduct electronic surveillance " and " congressional legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . " In September , Sen. Patrick J. Leahy , the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , asked Roberts about the scope of presidential power in the context of a 2002 Justice Department legal memorandum concerning harsh interrogations that were arguably forbidden by federal law . The Bush administration had by then disavowed aspects of the memorandum , but Leahy wanted to know about one of its more abstract assertions . " Congress can no more interfere , " the memorandum said , " with the president 's conduct of interrogations of enemy combatants than it can dictate strategic or tactical decisions on the battlefield . " The Bush administration has made similar arguments in connection with the surveillance program . Roberts said the framework for analyzing the question of whether the president had exceeded his authority was in a concurring opinion by Justice Robert H. Jackson in a 1952 decision rejecting President Harry S. Truman 's assertion that he had the inherent constitutional authority to seize private steel mills as a matter of national security during the Korean War . " Where the president is acting contrary to congressional authority , " Roberts said , "what Justice Jackson said is , the president 's authority is at its lowest ebb . " It is not clear whether Alito will also endorse Jackson 's approach . In a 2001 speech to the Federalist Society , a conservative legal group , Alito spoke in favor of vigorous and expansive executive power . As a government lawyer , too , he frequently argued for a broad interpretation of executive authority . CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY Perhaps no issue engaged the senators questioning Roberts more than a series of recent Supreme Court decisions limiting the ability of Congress to make federal law binding on the states or , sometimes , to legislate on a subject at all .
NW	A fire broke out at an orphanage for the disabled on Sunday in Dushanbe , the capital of Tajikistan , killing 13 children and seriously injuring a 10-year-old boy , officials said . The orphanage caught fire shortly after 1 a.m. when 92 children were in the building , in their beds , a fire dispatcher said in a telephone interview . By the time firefighters arrived , a portion of the roof had already collapsed , killing some of the children . Some of the children could not walk because of mental or physical disabilities , he said , and had to be carried out of the building . One 10-year-old boy was hospitalized with burns over 14 percent of his body . The dead ranged in age from 7 to 16 , the dispatcher said . The fire official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal investigation into the cause has not been completed , said a short circuit probably caused the fire . The orphanage relied on electrical heaters , which probably had been turned up during a cold snap on Saturday , he said . Temperatures in Dushanbe dropped to 23 degrees overnight . The official said the building had been cited for poor fire safety but that violations had not been corrected . Fire safety is dismal throughout the former Soviet Union , part of a larger problem of flagrant disregard for safety under certain circumstances that has led to a high rate of death from car crashes or industrial accidents . Tajikistan , bordering Afghanistan and China , is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the region . In much of the former Soviet Union , parents of disabled children typically entrust their care to state-run orphanages . The UNICEF office in Dushanbe said it would donate warm clothes and other emergency supplies to the survivors , Siddiq Y . Vakhidov , an employee , said in a telephone interview late on Sunday . The embassy of Iran , which has cultural ties to Tajikistan , whose residents speak a language related to Persian , promised help in rebuilding the orphanage , according to a report on the Interfax news agency .

NW	Giorgio Rocca is undefeated in slalom this season , and he won his fourth World Cup race in that discipline Sunday . But with the Olympic Games in his native Italy next month , he has asked people to resist comparing him to the former Olympic and World Cup champion Alberto Tomba . Adriano Iliffe , the manager of the Italian ski team , said : " You know , in Italy , they always like to put someone 's name beside Tomba 's . But Tomba was Tomba and Rocca is Rocca . They are two different people . " Rocca is a reserved and disciplined slalom specialist , more concerned with charity than sports cars . After winning two bronze medals at the world championships last winter , Rocca auctioned his equipment to raise money for hospitals in Afghanistan . Rocca finished the Adelboden slalom Sunday in 1 minute 39.14 seconds , six-tenths of a second ahead of Ted Ligety of the United States . Benjamin Raich of Austria was third . " Of course he is a big rival for me , and I really have to watch him , " Rocca said of Ligety , who stands behind him in the slalom standings . " He is a nice guy , and he has his own technique , but he is able to work on it to make it efficient and consistent . " Ligety was a forerunner at the Salt Lake Games , meaning he ran the slalom course just before the first racer , to test the timing systems and leave a groove in the snow . That event was held in his hometown , Park City , Utah , and Ligety was 17 and a member of the local ski team . Now 21 , Ligety is a strong contender for a medal in Turin . On Sunday , he was late for the postrace news conference because he was posing with three of his teammates for the cover of Sports Illustrated . " It all came quickly , and it 's pretty sweet , " he said . If people are looking for Tomba 's flamboyance , they are not going to find it in Ligety , who is polite and earnest , at least around reporters . On the hill , however , he can be outrageous . " He brings a lot of color to his skiing , " said Phil McNichol , the coach of the U.S. men 's team . " He skis a bold line and is loose in his ankles and knees . It 's an artistic approach , actually . " Ligety concedes that he makes a lot of it up as he goes along , relying on athletic instinct and sheer desire to save him when things inevitably go wrong . " I do n't ski with great tactics , " Ligety said . " I just ski with emotion . " In that way , he reminds some of Bode Miller , who often sends just his feet around the gates while the rest of his body plunges straight downhill , rocking back and forth with an awkward , rubbery technique that the former Olympic and World Cup champion Phil Mahre says reminds him of Gumby . But Miller has sublime speed and is arguably the fastest slalom skier in the world when he finishes both runs , which has happened only 22 times in his 74 career efforts . Miller crashed again Sunday .
NW	Armand P. Bartos , an architect and philanthropist who , with his wife , Celeste , supported major New York City cultural institutions , died at his home in Manhattan on Dec. 29 . He was 95 . His death followed several years of illness , said his son Armand Jr. Bartos ' most significant work of architecture is the Shrine of the Book , an onion-shaped structure at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem built to house the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient manuscripts . Designed with his partner , Frederick Kiesler , the building opened in 1965 and was cited as one of the year 's best by the American Institute of Architects . Bartos also designed a number of buildings on the Yeshiva University campus in New York City . He and his wife , who collected 20th-century art , made major gifts to the Museum of Modern Art , including a collection of 340 prints and grants to support film history and preservation . They were also benefactors of the New York Public Library , helping restore a magnificent yet virtually abandoned lecture hall featuring a 30-foot-high glass and cast-iron dome . The hall reopened in 1987 as the Celeste Bartos Forum . The Bartoses also supported the school of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Armand Phillip Bartos was born in New Rochelle , N.Y. , a son of recent immigrants from Hungary . He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania , earned an M.A. in architecture from MIT , and served in the Navy during World War II .

NW	Virtually sealed off from the outside world , residents of this violence-riddled strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea liken it to a giant , deteriorating prison , and at its worst it feels like the film " Escape From New York , " where inmates ran the show . The economy beats feebly , filling the streets with armed men and markets and chaotic traffic during the day and emptying them but for scattered police patrols and idle young men at night . The Palestinian Authority , charged with governing the territory together with the West Bank , maintains tenuous control . " The intifada has ended but the violent energy is still there , " said Eyad Sarraj , a psychiatrist and human rights activist living here . In Gaza City on Saturday night , one man was killed during a gunbattle between armed militants and the police . Further south that same day , gunmen cordoned off a neighborhood in Khan Yunis , Gaza 's second-largest city , while members of a well-known drug-smuggling family battled with the Palestinian police . Eleven policemen were reported wounded . And in Rafah , along the Egyptian border , armed men from the Abu Taha family stopped cars on Sunday , checking identification papers in hopes of catching members of the rival Al Masri family , with which they have been carrying on a deadly feud . While the world is watching Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's fight for life and wondering who will govern Israel in his absence , people in Gaza are far more preoccupied with growing lawlessness and tension between armed factions since Israel 's withdrawal . " One day , these guys woke up and had nothing to fire rockets at , but they had no food in the kitchen , so they turned on the Palestinian Authority , " said Khalid Abu Hilal , known as Abu Adham , a spokesman for 10 branches of Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , an armed wing of the Fatah political faction . " We are heading toward civil war . " The Gaza Strip , home to 1.4 million Palestinians , is growing more chaotic by the day . Part of the problem is Fatah 's inability to control the armed men who once did its bidding . Ever since Israel abandoned the settlements and withdrew its troops in September , opponents of the occupation have been idle . They lost the financial support they enjoyed and have grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of any reward for what they regard as years of sacrifice .
NW	TAMPA - Chris Simms limped on a sprained right ankle to his truck at One Buc Place , pausing to make small talk and sign a few footballs and battle flags for autograph seekers . He had stayed just long enough Sunday morning to take a mandatory physical and said he could only stomach to watch a few plays from the Bucs ' 17-10 loss to the Washington Redskins in Saturday 's NFC wild-card game . " Gosh , two or three plays can make you make the playoffs , miss the playoffs or win the Super Bowl , " Simms said . The third-year quarterback did n't make enough plays to win his first postseason game , but did his performance this season warrant a long-term contract from the Bucs ? That 's among the many questions the team began wrestling with Sunday , the start of what promises to be a very busy offseason . Chief among the dilemmas facing Tampa Bay is deciding whether to offer Simms a long-term deal or retain veteran Brian Griese , who is due a $ 2.6-million roster bonus before the start of free agency in March . Griese led the Bucs to a 5-1 start before a season-ending knee injury . Simms went 6-5 down the stretch , including three fourth-quarter comebacks . He is a restricted free agent , so the Bucs can match any offer . " I feel like I 've done enough good things this year to at least prove to people that I belong in this league and definitely can be a starting quarterback , " Simms said . " And we 'll just see where it goes from there . Of course , I 'd love to be here because I think this team has a lot of potential . " It 's strange . It has a little excitement to it , too , but then it has a little bit of the unknown and you wish and hope that everything kind of works out in your favor . I 'd like to just be here , in the same place . " The same is likely true for several others critical to the team 's success in 2005 . Defensive tackle Chris Hovan and kicker Matt Bryant become unrestricted free agents in March . Hovan was credited with helping the team finish first overall in total defense and improving from ninth to sixth against the run . Bryant hit 84 percent of his field goals . Tampa Bay also has to make decisions on right tackle Kenyatta Walker , receiver Ike Hilliard , safety Dexter Jackson and cornerback Juran Bolden . Perhaps seeking another playmaker for Simms , the Bucs reportedly are interested in signing receiver Terrell Owens , who will be released by Philadelphia next month . The possible road blocks would be the salary cap and Owens ' history of disruption , which led to the Eagles suspending him . " I think to bring T.O. in here , he 's a guy who 's going to have to know how we are on this team , " receiver Michael Clayton said . " I would think because of the past problems that would be a decision discussed by our head coach and our leaders . And if that 's what they want , if they honestly feel T.O. can come in here with a different mind-set , as a team player , then it 's going to be well-received to have a guy like that on this team . " Signing Owens could profoundly affect the salary cap , which is stretched to the limit by several core defenders with enormous salaries in '06 , including linebacker Derrick Brooks ( $ 7.75-million ) , defensive end Simeon Rice ( $ 6-million ) and defensive tackle Anthony McFarland ( $ 4.5-million ) . " Would I like to see this defense back ? I 'd love that , " cornerback Brian Kelly said . " But that 's ( general manager ) Bruce Allen 's job . That is n't my job . If this team could line up again in six months , we 'd get a championship . " The changes wo n't be limited to the roster . Only four top assistants are under contract and the Bucs are likely to lose defensive line coach Rod Marinelli and secondary coach Mike Tomlin , who is expected to interview with Minnesota for a job as defensive coordinator . Marinelli will interview for Detroit 's head coaching vacancy . On Sunday , Simms was still struggling with how the Bucs lost to the Redskins . LaVar Arrington returned an interception of a tipped pass to set up Clinton Portis ' 6-yard touchdown run and Sean Taylor returned a fumble 51 yards for another first-quarter score . Those turnovers spoiled arecord-setting performance by the defense , which held the Redskins to 120 yards - the lowest total for a winning team in postseason history . But Simms still was able to smile about his first playoff game . " It was a blast , being in that situation and the environment and you can just feel the electricity in the air and those flags waving , " Simms said . " It was cool . It 's just a shame because I feel like we 're a solid team and the NFC is wide open . I think when it comes down to it , it hurts because we do n't have anybody to blame but ourselves . "
NW	domestic product . The environmental damage , however , has been breathtaking . So far , the company has produced about 1 billion tons of waste , with 5 billion more tons to come before the operation shuts down . Some of this waste has been dumped into the mountains surrounding the mine , and some into a system of rivers that descend steeply into the island 's low-lying wetlands and coastal estuaries . The damage has been enough to render the rivers , wetlands and parts of the estuaries -- all critical to the food chain -- unsuitable for aquatic life . Meanwhile , records show that between 1998 and 2004 , Freeport gave officers in the police and military nearly $ 20 million in direct payments in addition to tens of millions more for military infrastructure like barracks and roads . The company told The Times that the payments were necessary to provide a secure working environment for its employees , and that " there is no alternative to our reliance on the Indonesian military and police . " Papua has long been home to a low-level , separatist insurgency against the central government , which made the company nervous . Yet what is missing from the company 's response is any recognition that its environmental practices contributed to the unrest and allowed the military to establish a strong presence in a region where it had barely a toehold before Freeport arrived . Freeport 's environmental record and its support for the Indonesian military have caused rumbles in Washington , particularly among human rights advocates like Patrick Leahy , a Democratic senator from Vermont . Citing human rights abuses , Congress in 1992 restricted arms sales and most American training for Indonesian officers , and it enacted new prohibitions in 1999 after a rampage by army-backed militia in what was then East Timor Province . Leahy sharply criticized Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 's decision to resume aid last year , which the administration described as a reward for Indonesia 's improved human rights record and its cooperation with the post-Sept . 11 counterterrorism campaign . Indonesia 's critics say that the present government is an improvement over the authoritarian rule of President Suharto , who ran the country for three decades ending in 1998 . Yet the military continues its abusive practices . Setting aside for the moment Freeport 's environmental horror show , the company is not doing Indonesia 's civilian authorities any favors by underwriting the generals . Freeport describes its payments as an essential cost of doing business . But it appears not to have measured the costs to democracy . HONING THE PROPER PUNISHMENT The Securities and Exchange Commission , under its chairman , Christopher Cox , took an important step in the fight against corporate malfeasance last week . By issuing guidelines on when and why it would impose fines , the commission added transparency to an oft-criticized process . Fines against companies often hurt the same group that the initial fraud injured : shareholders . Thus imposing big fines not only can be unfair at times , it also can go against the SEC 's mission to protect investors . Simply put , if the shareholders were harmed already , the SEC should try not to harm them again . The new guidelines say the decision to levy a fine will
NW	Audi took the wraps off the U.S. version of its first sports utility vehicle , the 2007 Q7 , this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show . The automaker also announced a starting price of $ 50,620 ( including freight ) for the 4.2-liter Quattro model , which goes on sale in June . No prices were announced for the 3.6-liter V-6 version , which will show up a few weeks later , or for the gasoline-electric hybrid model , which will be added to the lineup for 2008 -- the first hybrid SUV from a European automaker . Equipped with a V-8 engine with gasoline direct injection , the 4.2-liter Q7 will have 350 horsepower , a six-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission and the latest generation of Audi 's patented Quattro all-wheel-drive system . This system , during normal operation , sends 42 percent of the power to the front wheels and the rest to the rear . Ratios change automatically when wheel slippage occurs , such as on ice , snow or sand . Luxury features abound in this vehicle , which essentially is a high-end clone of the Volkswagen Touareg and a close cousin of the Porsche Cayenne . Those two SUVs have been on the market since 2004 and were developed jointly by Porsche and Volkswagen , Audi 's parent . Porsche builds the Cayenne separately from the Touareg and uses a Porsche engine and transmission , while VW will build the Audi in the plant that also makes the Touareg . The Q7 will use the same V-6 and V-8 engines as the Touareg . Standard on the Q7 4.2 Quattro are such amenities as adaptive bi-xenon headlights , seven-passenger leather seating , power tailgate , automatic dual-zone climate control , 18-inch alloy wheels , 5,500-pound towing capacity , cruise control and keyless entry . A cold-weather package with heated steering wheel and front - and second-row seats lists for $ 850 , and a $ 2,400 technology package adds a rearview camera with rear parking system , a side-assist system that monitors the vehicle 's blind spots , advanced key keyless entry and voice control . Other options on the 4.2 Quattro will include a three-panel panoramic sunroof , 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels , four-zone automatic climate control ( including rear control panel ) , 6,600-pound towing package , satellite radio , DVD navigation , air suspension , radar cruise control and the side-assist system ( as a stand-alone option ) . Standard safety features include dual front and front-side air bags , side curtain air bags for all three rows of seats , four-wheel antilock disc brakes , electronic stability control with rollover sensing and pre-tensioning three-point seatbelts for all seven passengers . Rear side air bags will be optional , the company said . With the introduction of the Q7 , Audi finally gets its own sports utility . The all-wheel-drive system will be standard on all models . The Cayenne and Touareg already are regarded as two of the most capable off-road performers on the market . I 've tested both on some very rugged trails that normally would require highly modified off-road vehicles such as Jeep Wranglers and CJs to negotiate , and the Porsche/VW models handled the terrain with ease . But with prices ranging into the $ 50,000s or more , this vehicle will see more highways than byways and more country clubs than countryside . People just do n't take expensive SUVs into the woods very much . There 's a certain logic to that . Why risk banging up the fenders and rocker panels of a luxury vehicle along some rocky trail ? Porsche also offers V-6 and normally aspirated V-8 versions of the Cayenne , with starting prices in the mid-$ 40,000s for the V-6 . As for the Q7 , the vehicle gets the new trapezoidal Audi grille design that has become the new face of the brand . And although its overall shape is similar to those of the Touareg and Cayenne , it does have its own look . The Q7 will have ground clearance of up to 7.9 inches to help it avoid obstacles on the trail . As for interior amenities , the Germans are finally getting the message : Americans like cup holders . The Q7 will have 10 of them throughout the passenger compartment . Three rows of seating are offered for carrying up to seven passengers , and Audi says middle-seat leg room will be best in class . The second - and third-row seats can be folded flat in a variety of configurations to accommodate more people or more cargo . Behind the third seat is 11.7 cubic feet of cargo space ; with the third seat folded , that expands to 27.4 . The tailgate lifts up in one piece , just as it does on the Touareg and Cayenne , but the Q7 will offer an electrically operated tailgate , a feature first introduced by Chrysler in its line of Dodge and Chrysler minivans . No extra money need be spent to prep the Q7 for trailer-towing ; all models will come with a trailer hitch and wiring , Audi says . In North America , the 4.2-liter V-8 will be rated at 350 horsepower and 324 foot-pounds of torque . It will propel the Q7 from zero to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds and give the vehicle a top speed of 154 mph . The V-6 engine will arrive in September , rated at 280 horsepower . No fuel economy ratings have been announced for the Q7 , but the V-6 version of the Touareg is EPA-rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 21 on the highway . The V-8 is rated at 14 city/18 highway . ( Send your car questions to G. Chambers Williams III , San Antonio Express-News , P.O.

NW	After living with luggage every working day for the last five years , Donna Menefee has come to believe that cheaper is just fine . Menefee , a Delta Air Lines customer service agent , helps run its lost and damaged luggage office at Logan International Airport 's Terminal A , which serves 100,000 Delta passengers a week . On an average day , she might handle a half-dozen claims of luggage damage . In her experience , accidents do n't discriminate . " The biggest thing in our office is I have people coming in and saying , ' I spent $ 300 for my luggage ! " ' Menefee said . Her standard answer : " Well , OK , that 's great . But it got damaged . " Menefee said top-of-the-line luggage sets like those made by Hartman , Tumi , and Swiss Army are "very good bags , very good warranties - and very expensive . Of course , it 's a better-looking bag . It 's got a better frame . The workmanship is a little better . Whatever they ca n't repair , they replace . " But she said of the costliest luggage sets : " They tear , they rip , just like Wal-Mart bags . " Luggage runs a hard obstacle course from the time passengers check in until they reclaim it at their destination , slung by time-pressed handlers onto carts and trolleys , with some of the hardest knocks coming when it slides down the chute into the carousel . US consumers spent $ 8.3 billion in 2004 on luggage , sport bags , briefcases , and computer cases , according to the Travel Goods Association , a Princeton , N.J. , trade group . That was down from $ 9.1 billion in 2000 , as travel dropped after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and low-priced imports cut retail prices . Unless you 're toting expensive cameras or high-tech equipment that warrants a reinforced case , most no-name brands available at off-price stores like Marshall 's or T.J. Maxx should prove adequate , Menefee said . She bought her last set of luggage five or six years ago for around $ 50 a bag - " no particular brand name " that she can recall - and it has worked out fine for her frequent trips . So hard or soft cover bags ? " I 'm more against hard-sided . It does n't expand , and most people tend to overpack them . They pop , they get crushed , and there 's no away to repair them , " Menefee said . " The hard cases do n't rip . They just crack . You ca n't repair the crack . You can repair the rip . " Some other lessons : Do something to differentiate your luggage , such as a painted or duct-tape marking . But put it on the body , not the handle , in case that snaps off . Also , do n't assume that an unusual color is unique . Menefee recently had to solve a mixup involving a passenger whose beige suitcase was mistakenly taken home by another passenger . Which leads to : Always check your tags before you leave the airport , and put a piece of paper inside the bag , too with your phone numbers , e-mail , and regular mail . Indulge your inner cheapskate . A $ 200 suitcase is virtually never four times as tough as a $ 50 case . " It 's a myth , " Menefee said . " Luggage is there to protect your clothes . Everything else is cosmetic . " Peter J. Howe can be reached at howeglobe .com .
NW	Q : Over the years I have battled to keep my home movie collection in a format viewable with current technology . I 've transferred them from 8 mm film to VHS videotape . Later I transferred the VHS videotape onto DVD discs , viewable on my home DVD player . I read a recent story that the switch to HDTV is now definite . What is going to happen to all the current DVD discs out there , including my old home movies ? Am I going to have to convert the "old " DVD format into another format compatible with the HDTV that I will eventually have to buy ? I presume there will be new HDTV DVD disc media and new players to play the new media , as the file size of an HDTV movie will not fit onto a current DVD. Will these old discs still be compatible and play on the new HDTV DVD players and HDTV monitors ? Or am I facing another conversion process ? Will my existing DVD player 's output signal be viewable ( at a lower resolution ) on a HDTV monitor , or will an older DVD player even hook up to a new HDTV monitor ? -- Mike Aleksick A: There are a lot of good questions here , and I bet you are not alone in wondering about these issues . So let 's cut to the chase : All the video you have stored on DVD now will work fine as the broadcasters move from sending out analog signals to digital ones . Let 's stop here , just for the sake of accuracy : The real switch is from analog TV to digital TV . All HDTV sets are digital , but not all digital sets offer a high-definition picture . That said , you 're right in thinking that you 'll be able to buy a movie DVD recorded in HDTV before long . And if you have an HDTV player , you can pop that DVD in and be amazed at the improvement in resolution over today 's DVDs . The good news is that you 'll also be able to view your old DVDs on that same player . You also asked whether you 'd be able to connect your current DVD to an HDTV set . You sure can . My own DVD player is connected to my HDTV set right now . And it works just fine . Now , everything I 've said is true for the immediate future . During the first few years , as Americans move from analog to digital , the old and new should get along fine . But as time goes by , that will change . So you 'll face the day when you will once again need to transfer your old home movies to a new format -- maybe one that does n't even exist today . Q : I have SpyBot and Ad-aware Personal installed on my machine and run them periodically . They are , of course , the free versions . The other day , I saw an ad for a free download of Noadware 4.0, another anti-adware program . Immediately before I ran it , I ran SpyBot and Ad-aware . After cleaning up what they found , I ran Noadware 4.0. It found one registry item , 37 cookies and 29 files that it said should be deleted . The catch is , to remove these items one must pay $ 29.95 , a one-time fee . Incidentally , Spybot said that Noadware was an adware/spyware item . So what is a body to do ? I would n't mind paying for a good system that would find all spyware/adware items . -- Meredith E. Bynum A: Noadware is not a program I can recommend . In my opinion , it uses advertising that is misleading . It also uses scare tactics to induce the user to pay for what had been billed as a free product . It 's not alone in using these tactics . Several other programs out there use the same methods . Here 's what a anti-adware product review site ( www.adwarereport.com ) had to say about Noadware : " It is heavily advertised on the Internet as an effective adware removal tool . Our tests indicate differently , however . We uncovered a product that was unable to detect real adware on our computer , and instead tried to fool us with 'false positive . ' " The two programs you use now -- SpyBot and Ad-aware -- are legitimate and effective . No one program will find all adware and spyware . But , used together , these two do a fine job .

NW	DIET -- EARLY HEALTH PROBLEMS PREDICT LATER EATING WOES Medical problems at birth increase the risk of anorexia and bulimia later , a new study reports . Babies ' early eating difficulties , poor muscle tone , low birth weight and a placenta with defective blood circulation were all associated with eating disorders by the time the children were 16 to 18 years old . Diabetes and anemia in the mother were also linked to eating disorders in the children , as was preeclampsia , a common maternal syndrome characterized by high blood pressure , fluid retention and kidney problems . The study , in the January issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry , analyzed the obstetric records of 114 young people with anorexia , 73 with bulimia and 554 others with neither . To prevent bias , the researchers examining the obstetric records did not know which belonged to people with disorders . If the mother had anemia , the risk of anorexia was more than doubled , and maternal diabetes increased the risk by a factor of four . Babies with early cardiac problems were also more likely to suffer from anorexia later in life , as were those who needed oxygen administered at birth . Subjects with bulimia were more likely to have had low birth weight , early feeding problems and defective placentas . " It is important to keep in mind that we are speaking of risk factors , and not causative factors , " said Paolo Santonastaso , the senior author and a professor of psychiatry at the University of Padua in Italy . " This means that most babies with obstetric complications will never develop an eating disorder . " Santonastaso also emphasized the importance of a combination of factors . " We generally think that single complications are less important than the effect of the number of complications , " he said . PREDICTORS -- OVERWEIGHT CHILDREN LINKED TO OVERWEIGHT PARENTS Researchers have found that the best predictor of youths ' being at a healthy weight is having two parents who are of normal weight . For those teenagers who did have an obese parent , the best protective factor against being overweight was eating breakfast every day . The report appears in the January issue of The Journal of the American Dietetic Association . In a nationally representative sample of 1,890 youths ages 12 to 16 , about 71 percent of both boys and girls were of normal weight , with body mass indexes from the 15th to 85th percentile . But only 62 percent of children whose mothers were obese were of normal weight . Fewer than 40 percent of children with two obese parents had normal weights . Participation in two or more organized exercise programs during the preceding year provided some protection against obesity , but neither hours spent watching television nor the number of times per week that teenagers exercised had much bearing . " The main message is that regular breakfast consumption has a protective effect , " said Heather Fiore , the lead author and a clinical nutrition specialist at Strong Children 's Diabetes Center in Rochester . " We do n't know exactly why it helps , but there 's certainly no harm in eating breakfast every day . It has numerous benefits
NW	In fairness , North Carolina 's minimum wage is overdue to be raised . Inflation has chipped away at the value of $ 5.15 , the minimum hourly wage required by federal law nine years ago . Today , it takes $ 6.26 to buy what $ 5.15 bought in 1997 . Against that background , it 's apparent that State Treasurer Richard Moore is n't climbing too far out on a limb with his proposal that the state minimum wage be raised to $ 6.15 an hour . Nevertheless , it takes moxie to call for even that modest increase in front of business groups that have steadfastly resisted any increase at all . Understandably , Moore does n't spend much time extolling the benefits of an extra dollar an hour to workers . Members of the N.C . Citizens for Business and Industry have been more concerned that raising the minimum would drive up labor costs enough to crimp profits . Moore 's case rests on the effect that bare-minimum employers have on their competition : The more their workers are forced into public programs , the more tax revenue must be collected from businesses to pay for them . Taxes crimp profits , too . Because of a rosy economic outlook , now is an opportune moment to even things up for employers and workers alike . Business investment and expansion predicted for this year promise to blunt the impact of higher labor costs on bottom lines . Besides , higher wages would serve North Carolina 's goal of stimulating the economy beyond its growing cities . More money in the hands of low-skill workers would be spent in areas of the state without many high-paying jobs . Workers earning the current minimum wage ca n't afford to shop at Wal-Mart stores , one reason why Wal-Mart 's chairman recently called on Congress to raise the federal minimum . A simpler reason for lawmakers to act would be fairness to hard-working people . Raleigh News &amp; Observer editorial
NW	In just a few short years , Apple Computer Inc. and its iPod portable media players changed the way consumers get music and movies on the go . Is Apple now planning to do the same with entertainment inside the home ? When company co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs opens Apple 's Macworld Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday , industry analysts and others widely expect he 'll announce new software and hardware designed to carry iPod 's successes into the living room . New ultra-thin Apple laptops and possibly a new Mac Mini desktop could easily link up with TVs to record and pause live television programming , play video discs and music , and show off digital photos and home movies , many Apple watchers predict . They 'll likely run on Intel Corp. processors - a first for Apple - and could include Intel 's new Viiv ( rhymes with five ) technology designed for home entertainment . Industry analysts also predict the company might release updates to its entertainment-related software , including its year-old Front Row program for browsing music , video and pictures . Notoriously secretive Apple has said nothing publicly about what Jobs might introduce Tuesday . But a bigger push into home entertainment "has to be something they 're looking at , " said Steve Baker , vice president of technology research company NPD Group . Why ? Because even though Apple virtually created the current market for portable media players , it has less than 5 percent of the overall market for PCs and is barely a contender in the nascent business of computers designed specifically for home entertainment . Also , the convergence of portable and home entertainment is considered to be the future of the digital lifestyle . Apple 's main rivals - Microsoft Corp. and the manufacturers of Windows-based computers - are pushing hard to dominate the digital living room with their "media center " PCs . Last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Microsoft said sales of PCs running its Windows XP Media Center operating system rose by 300 percent last year . More than 6.5 million of the entertainment-focused PCs have been sold since 2002 , according to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates . Microsoft and its partners also showed off new media center software and hardware designed to improve the way consumers can move digital content around between their TVs , portable devices and home PCs . " The media center PC numbers have been rising pretty steadily , " said Roger Kay , president of research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. " Consumers have shown they want the digital home . " Despite Microsoft 's head start , Apple has some major assets in its corner - namely its best-selling iPods , which now play videos , and its related iTunes online music and video store . Beginning this week , it also will likely have a new heavyweight partner . Apple is widely expected to introduce its first computers containing processors from Intel , which could dramatically widen the company 's appeal beyond its niche of hard-core devotees . To mass-market computer users , the Intel logo would be a comforting signal that Apple machines will be compatible with other equipment in their homes and in the tech world at large . Apple last year struck a potentially revolutionary deal to replace chips from IBM Corp. and Austin , Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor Inc. with Intel chips in its computers beginning this year . In December , Apple and Intel also quietly helped launch a new tech industry consortium designed to create new standards to improve the flow of content between TVs , computers and other devices . Kurt Scherf , principal analyst at Dallas-based research outfit Parks Associates , said he thinks Apple plans to introduce a revamped version of its Mac Mini computer designed specifically as a home entertainment hub . He also predicts Apple will announce new deals for content like its recent agreements with big TV networks such as NBC , ABC and Disney for programming for its iPods . " They 've definitely already set the precedent in content " and portable devices , Scherf said . " Now they 've got to try to seriously address the living room with some sort of media server of their own . " The Mac Mini , small enough to be held in one hand but packed with enough power to handle home entertainment , seems like the most likely candidate , Scherf said . Baker , the NPD analyst , predicted that any Apple push into home entertainment would likely include all its computers , not just a single one like the Mac Mini . And then , given Apple 's propensity for surprise , others predict something completely different . The Apple Core , an online Web site for Apple enthusiasts , speculated that the company may introduce new big-screen plasma TVs with Mac computers built into them . Such new Apple TVs , the site predicted Monday , could download movies , organize home pictures and videos , and play music , all with a single remote control .

NW	training film was discovered , full of tantalizing hints about the nature of the experiment on the island . Channel 4 , the British network that broadcasts Lost , has a spooky bunch of video-clip puzzles at www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/main .html . ALL ABOUT LOST Lost has such an enormous online presence that there are sites that guide fans to all the other sites . One of the most comprehensive is lostlinks .net , run by Mark Bishop . LostLinks catalogs everything from episode transcripts to message boards , from translations of Jin and Sun 's Korean conversations and Jack 's Chinese-character tattoos to the " Get Hurley Some Lovin' Petition , " asking the series ' creators to rustle up a honey for the show 's big man . Bishop , a New Jersey resident who works in information technology , started LostLinks just three or four episodes into the show 's first season . " I had never visited a message board before , but I decided to check out the official ABC forums after stumbling across the official Lost Web site . I was fascinated by the depth of the conversations , " he wrote in an e-mail . When he started Googling Lost sites , he found so many that he created LostLinks as a clearinghouse . Bishop also runs lostinoahu.com , with information on shooting locations for the show and cast members ' hangouts in Hawaii . At its peak , Bishop says , LostLinks was getting up to half a million hits a month . At the beginning of the second season , he announced he was shutting it down , but he got so many pleas from fans and other Web masters that he relented , although he has scaled back the time he spends on it . The two sites still get 75,000 to 100,000 hits per month . " The Lost fan base grew very fast , and the number of Lost-related Web sites is almost astronomical , " Bishop says . " I think that response has a lot to do with the large , diverse cast , which makes fans from different backgrounds feel like they are part of the show . And fans really do feel like they are part of the show , tracking down clues and formulating theories . It 's almost a pseudo-reality for some . But who has n't dreamed of being stranded on a tropical island ? " Lost sites are n't just about Sawyer 's abs or what Walt 's ghost says when you play the audio backward . Just ask Amy Bauer , an assistant professor of music theory at the University of California Irvine and the Web master for the Society for the Study of Lost at loststudies.com . " As an academic who likes pop culture , I became enamored of the early X-Files enough to write a paper on it , and then became involved in Buffy ( the Vampire Slayer ) studies , " she writes in an e-mail . She became active on www.losttv-forum.com , which was online months before the show began and which Bauer calls " the premier site on the Web" for Lost discussion . " I was amazed at the high quality of discourse surrounding this show , " she says . " There were people from all walks of life - scientists , journalists , engineers , English majors ( not just fanboys and girls ) asking intelligent questions about the show and probing
NW	Men who have been screened for prostate cancer by the most commonly used tests have no greater chance of surviving the disease than those who have not been screened at all , new research has found . A report on the research , published Monday in The Archives of Internal Medicine , found that neither a prostate specific antigen test , known as a PSA , nor a rectal examination worked to reduce deaths from prostate cancer . The value of the screening has long been a matter of debate . A PSA level can be abnormal even when a man does not have prostate cancer . But when an abnormal PSA level is discovered , typically the next step is a biopsy . Even a biopsy is inconclusive , however . The tissue sample from a negative screening , for example , may by chance have come from a part of the prostate that is free of cancerous cells . Even if a cancer is found , an operation , which often causes erectile dysfunction and incontinence as side effects , may not be necessary since many cancers are so slow growing that they will never cause a problem . Dr. John Concato , a researcher at the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System and the lead author on the paper , stressed that a physician was obligated to clarify all the issues for patients . " He should explain the benefits and risks , in the context of each patient 's values , " Concato said . " For example , some patients place such a high premium on avoiding incontinence and impotence that a positive PSA test can be problematic . " The research involved nearly 72,000 men over 50 who received outpatient care at any of 10 Veterans Affairs hospitals in New England . Of this group , the scientists identified 1,425 men with prostate cancer that was diagnosed from 1991 to 1995 and then studied the records of 501 patients who had died of the disease as of 1999 . For each case , the researchers randomly selected a living patient to be part of a control group . Screening with PSA had been performed for 70 of the men who died and for 65 men in the control group used for comparison . If screening had been effective , a lower proportion of screened patients would have been found among the group of men who had died . But this was not the case . An editorial accompanying the report states that 78 percent of male primary care physicians and 95 percent of urologists over 50 have themselves had at least one PSA screening , so they apparently have decided that the test is useful . " Many urologists and other physicians have received the PSA test , perhaps because they do n't consider the issue of screening to be uncertain , " said Concato . " They believe the test works , but our results do n't support that position . " Dr. Michael J. Barry , the author of the editorial and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard , said that a doctor 's personal decision to have the test or to decline it need not affect his ability to inform a patient properly . " Whatever the doctor 's beliefs , he should still be capable of giving a patient enough objective information to arrive at an informed conclusion for himself , " Barry said in an e-mail message . " I think it 's quite feasible to present the pros and cons of a medical intervention like a PSA test and have the patient reach a different decision than the doctor would , " he continued . Barry said that at age 52 , he had not had a PSA test himself , but he added that he routinely presented the option to his patients . " After a discussion , " he said , "many decide to go ahead and be tested . " The authors said their study was carefully controlled to eliminate bias and included a large population , increasing the validity of the results . At the same time , they acknowledged that there are good studies with different findings , and that more research would be needed to settle the question of whether prostate cancer screening does more harm than good , or the reverse .
NW	The Arthur in Julian Barnes ' new novel is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , the creator of Sherlock Holmes . The George in the novel is one George Edalji , a half-Indian solicitor who was convicted in 1903 of mutilating farm animals in his rural parish . And the tale Barnes recounts is the real-life-inspired story of how Arthur took up George 's case and by playing detective tried to restore George 's good name . Readers familiar with Barnes ' earlier work -- his sly , fictional improvisation on the life of Gustave Flaubert ( "Flaubert 's Parrot " ) or his highly subjective , collage-like history of the world ( " A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters " ) -- might have expected him to use the story of Arthur and George as an armature for some sophisticated , postmodernist games or as the jumping-off point for philosophical musings about , say , the gaps between life and art or the difficulty of understanding the past . Instead , Barnes has decided to write a straight-ahead historical novel -- a task he completes in a clumsy and lugubrious fashion . Though " Arthur &amp; George " is smoothly written and professionally assembled , it 's a ponderous performance -- crammed full of historical research and re-creations of period details and overstuffed with evidence relating to George 's legal case . Perhaps Barnes has gone into such minute detail in an effort to show just how George was railroaded in the first place or how cleverly Arthur has tracked down evidence to exonerate him . Or perhaps Barnes simply wanted to cram into these pages all the evidence his own research turned up . Whatever the intent , it 's a strategy that backfires : the reader does n't experience the thrill of putting together clues -- the way one does when reading a good detective story -- but instead feels bombarded by a blizzard of boring bits of data . We learn far more than we could possibly want to know about the farm animals found with their guts slashed open in the parish of Great Wyrley . We learn far more than we could possibly want to know about the threatening and bigoted letters received by George 's family in the years before the animal mutilations . And we learn far more than we could possibly want to know about the atrocious behavior of the local police , who seem to have had it in for George from the beginning . The sections where this novel does take flight are those in which Barnes seems to have taken imaginative liberties , fleshing out gaps in the historical record or simply embroidering known facts : George 's sheltered , hermetic childhood ; Arthur 's efforts over a decade to sustain relationships with two women ( his invalid wife , Touie , and a younger woman named Jean , with whom he falls madly in love ) ; the title characters ' prickly relationship , which grew out of desperation on George 's part and missionary zeal on Arthur 's . In such passages , the new emotional depth that surfaced in Barnes ' recent collection " The Lemon Table " slips into view , lending the story an intimacy and psychological tension that the remainder of the novel sadly lacks . As depicted by Barnes , Arthur and George emerge as full-blown romantics and old-fashioned men of honor . Shy , diffident and immensely dignified , George refuses to believe that racism might have played a role in his arrest and conviction , and as a lawyer he clings to his faith in the courts , convinced , at least at the beginning of his ordeal , that justice will prevail . Arthur , who grew up on stories of King Arthur and his Round Table , wants to live up to chivalric ideals . He sees his life as a series of knightly quests , and while he feels burdened by his reputation as the creator of Sherlock Holmes , he decides to put his fame to good use : he sets out not only to prove George 's innocence and win him restitution , but also to identify the real miscreant who committed the crimes in the first place . " I am going to make a great deal of noise , " he tells George . " The English -- the official English -- do not like noise . They think it vulgar ; it embarrasses them . But if calm reason has not worked , I shall give them noisy reason . I shall not use the back stairs but the front steps . I shall bang a big drum . " In real life , George 's case -- as championed by Arthur -- will be compared to the Dreyfus affair and will make English legal history , helping to lead to the establishment of a Court of Appeals . As raw material for this historical novel , however , it makes for less than compelling reading , resulting in a serviceable but decidedly sluggish book . By Julian Barnes 386 pages . Alfred A.

NW	These are not good times for coral reefs . Ravaged by warming oceans , pollution and disease , they need all the help they can get . Marine reserves , protected areas where fishing is banned , might be useful in helping reefs thrive . " People have used marine reserves to manage reef fish for many years , " said Peter J. Mumby , a biologist at the University of Exeter in Britain . " They are a potential tool to manage reefs , as well . " But is what 's good for the fish good for the coral ? In the Caribbean , scientists have n't been sure . Reserves that allow predatory fish like grouper to flourish , the thinking goes , may be inadvertently harming the reefs by reducing the grouper 's prey , parrotfish that help the coral to grow . So Mumby and colleagues set out to see whether this was so , by studying fish populations at a reserve in the Bahamas . Their finding , published in the journal Science , is that parrotfish , far from being wiped out , are prospering . " This reserve that allowed predators to come back also allowed parrotfish to come back , " Mumby said . Parrotfish graze on reefs , eating seaweed that can crowd out the coral , outcompeting it for nutrients and space . Until about 20 years ago , long-spine sea urchins also ate the seaweed . But disease eliminated most of the urchins , leaving the parrotfish as the only grazer . The researchers found that , at the Bahamian reserve , grouper thrived . And these predators did sharply reduce the population of smaller parrotfish species . But Mumby and his colleagues found that parrotfish longer than about 6 inches were too big for the grouper to eat . So larger species actually showed population gains . The larger parrotfish were also prodigious grazers . So while the loss of smaller parrotfish caused a slight reduction in grazing , the larger fish more than made up for it . In all , there was a net doubling of grazing , leading to a fourfold reduction in the amount of seaweed on the reef . " This is the first time that anyone has shown that setting up a marine park could have a beneficial effect on reducing the seaweed , " Mumby said . But more than that , he added , it is another indication of the complex interconnections in any ecosystem . " It 's never that simple , " he said . "Ecosystems are always full of surprises . "
NW	Two suicide bombers carrying police identity cards walked up to an Interior Ministry checkpoint on Monday morning and blew themselves up hundreds of yards from a ceremony attended by the American ambassador , killing at least 18 police officers and wounding 25 , officials said . Al-Qaida in Mesopotamia immediately claimed responsibility for the attack , which took place shortly before noon inside a secure zone shared by the city 's Police Academy . Iraq 's interior and defense ministers were also at the event , commemorating the formation of the Iraqi Police , but the officials , including the ambassador , were far enough away that the blast did not endanger them . The bombers , who were wearing suicide vests under plain clothes , were able to walk into an area near the ministry , which is closed to cars , according to a police officer who witnessed the attack . In a troubling lapse of security , the men had obtained police badges and showed them at a checkpoint at the north gate of the ministry . The blasts were audible at the ceremony , which proceeded uninterrupted about a quarter of a mile away , an American military spokesman said . The attacks appeared to be calculated to inflict maximum harm , with the second bomber blowing himself up just as a crowd of policemen gathered to help victims from the first . Reports of casualties varied wildly , with some news agencies putting the death toll at 28 . A relative lull in violence was broken last week when more than 180 Iraqis were killed in a spate of attacks , including at least one on a mosque and another on a police recruiting center . The violence comes as Iraq 's major ethnic and religious groups are negotiating the shape of a new government . Sunni Arab radicals are responsible for many of the violent attacks here , and American officials are hoping that broad Sunni participation in a new government will quell them . Also on Monday , The Christian Science Monitor confirmed the kidnapping of Jill Carroll , a 28-year-old American freelance writer on assignment for the paper . In a statement , the paper said Carroll was abducted from a neighborhood in western Baghdad on Saturday morning . Her interpreter , Allan Enwiyah , 32 , was shot dead at the scene . The kidnapping took place less than 200 yards from the office of Adnan al-Dulaimy , a prominent Sunni Arab politician , whom Carroll had been intending to interview at 10 a.m.
NW	Cox News Service ATLANTA -- Georgia could be in the running for a $ 1.2 billion auto plant that may be one of the largest investments in the South by a carmaker in more than a decade . West Point , Ga. , in Troup County near the Alabama border for a manufacturing plant that could create 2,500 jobs , according to an economic development trade publication . Kia wanted to build its plant in Mississippi , but has turned to Georgia in recent weeks as that site and others in rival Southern states lost their luster , said Mike Randle , publisher of Birmingham-based Southern Business and Development magazine . Kia "has run out of options " and is under a self-imposed deadline to start construction on a new plant by June , Randle said . " This is Georgia 's to win or lose . " Officials at the state Department of Economic Development and the LaGrange-Troup County Chamber of Commerce would n't comment on any negotiations with Kia . A Kia spokesman in Korea could not be reached . Kia 's plant , if built , would cost more than $ 1.2 billion , making it one of the largest investments in the South by an automaker since General Motors Corp. built its Saturn facility in Spring Hill , Tenn. , in 1990 , Randle said . Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said in August that Kia was considering Meridian , Miss. , for a new U.S. plant . Since then , Kia has reportedly expressed reservations about that site . Automotive News , an industry trade magazine , reported last month that Kia also was looking at Chattanooga , Tenn. ; Decatur , Ala. ; Aiken , S.C. ; and Hopkinsville , Ky . But Randle believes those states may be less willing to offer Kia the incentives it is seeking . Kia is part of Korean automaker Hyundai . West Point is now in play because it 's close to Hyundai 's plant in Montgomery , Ala. , as well as that plant 's 35 suppliers , which would supply a Kia facility , Randle said . Georgia may be more willing to offer Kia a fat incentive package , as Georgia has failed to attract a new automaker while it stands to lose both its existing plants , Randle said . General Motors said in November it would close its Doraville facility by 2008 . Ford Motor Co. could shutter its Hapeville plant when the company announces a major restructuring Jan . 23 . Georgia has failed twice - in 2002 and again last year - to persuade DaimlerChrysler to build a van plant in coastal Pooler .

NW	'70s like " The Last House on the Left " and " The Hills Have Eyes . " The director , who 's remaking " The Hills Have Eyes , " says making " Red Eye " felt like a B-movie "back in the day when they were done quickly and had great people in the casts . ... I think that 's the spirit in which it was made , and that 's why it worked out so well . " It did indeed , with the film being both a critical and financial success . The 66-year-old director is plunging back into more projects besides the " Hills " remake , including an HBO film and a magic show he 's developing for Las Vegas called " Wes Craven 's Magic Macabre . " " I took the HBO film even though I was being offered a very , very large $ 125 million film . I really liked the script for the HBO film , and I was n't sure about the script for the big one ; so I just passed and made a choice to do what was really interesting .

Like " Scenes , " " Saraband " was originally made for television and has a theatrical sense to it . ( Bergman has mostly concentrated on theater for the last couple of decades . ) It might be advisable to see " Marriage " first -- which tells of the breakup of Johan and Marianne ( Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson ) , but " Saraband " stands on its own -- a disturbing final journey into Bergman 's psychic twilight , the terrain of which Ullmann and Josephson know well . As a Memphis pimp named DJay with dreams of becoming a rap star , Terrence Howard gives a performance in " Hustle &amp; Flow " that finely captures the many sides of his complex character . Howard -- who has shown off his talents in a number of films this year , including " Crash " -- is the best thing about " Hustle , " for which he received a Golden Globe nomination . While the film has a lot of bravado with its rap music soundtrack and gangsta dialogue ( it was a Sundance Film Festival audience favorite ) , all of that simply masks an old-fashioned tale of the underdog trying to score big . Scripts for films like " Transporter 2" are half as long as most , with directions like "long car chase here , lots of crashes , see stunt coordinator , " and "here hero takes on a dozen or so bad guys armed with assorted tools , see stunt coordinator . " Luckily this film , starring Jason Statham as the driver for hire , never slows down to let you ponder its silliness ; so it becomes moderately entertaining .

But he steered clear of any discussion about his views on abortion , presidential power and other divisive issues , setting up a more direct confrontation with Democrats on Tuesday over his suitability for the court . On the opening day of the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Alito sketched his background and set out only a very generalized description of a belief in the need for independent-minded jurists . " The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desirable result for the client in the particular case at hand , " Alito said in remarks that lasted about 11 minutes . " But a judge ca n't think that way . A judge ca n't have any agenda . A judge ca n't have any preferred outcome in any particular case . And a judge certainly does n't have a client . " The judge 's only obligation -- and it 's a solemn obligation -- is to the rule of law , " he continued . " And what that means is that in every single case , the judge has to do what the law requires . " The day 's proceedings began the formal process of weighing Alito 's nomination to the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , who is retiring . President Bush , after having breakfast with Alito at the White House on Monday morning , told reporters that he wanted the Senate to "give this man a fair hearing and an up or down vote on the Senate floor . " Setting out the liberal case against Alito , Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D-Mass. , said he had grave concerns about what he characterized as Alito 's support for an "all-powerful executive branch , " a record of supporting powerful institutions over individuals , hostility to the concept of one person , one vote and opposition to abortion rights . He also raised questions about Alito 's credibility . Republicans portrayed him as exceedingly well qualified and well within the mainstream of conservative thought . " I want to remind the American people that this nominee , Judge Alito , has been confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate , not once but twice , " said Sen. Charles Grassley , R-Iowa , referring to Alito 's nomination to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 15 years ago and his earlier confirmation as a federal prosecutor .
NW	UPN 'S new motto , "where the girls are , " is something of a siren call for men , too . Pretty simple to figure our why : Girls mean bikinis and cleavage and catty models . Guys also like wrestling and did we mention the models ? Yes , UPN has figured out that it needs women , but in order to thrive , it needs programs that pull in their brothers and boyfriends . It tried and failed a few seasons ago with " Platinum , " and last year , " Kevin Hill " lost its snap halfway through the season . Let us not speak of the abomination that was " Sex , Love &amp; Secrets " except to say that now the network wants to give prime-time soaps a try . So now we have " South Beach , " which has its two-hour premiere Wednesday before settling into its regular 8 p.m. slot next week . Everything UPN wants to be is blended into this sudser : models , miles of lovely Miami beaches and hot young guys . Does n't sound butch enough , does it ? Which is why guns , fistfights , double-crossing and frequent forays into the criminal underworld have been thrown in for good measure . The " Miami Vice " entertainment philosophy clearly is at work here . Where there are babes , there be boys ; and to help them stay , you gotta pop off a couple of caps into some fools . " South Beach " could fall into guilty pleasure territory , but it really is as corny as it sounds . Heading its gorgeous multiracial cast is Vanessa Williams , starring as Elizabeth Bauer , the steely hotel owner with a heart of gold . Williams deserves credit for being able to say things like , " You ca n't let the pastel surfaces and sunlight fool you -- South Beach will eat you alive ! " and make it sound passable . Another tiny mercy is that there happens to be the slightest whiff of " Entourage " appeal to the adventures of Brooklyn boys Matt ( Marcus Coloma ) and Vincent ( Chris Johnson ) . Vincent 's a troublemaker who decides to head down to Miami on a whim ; college-bound Matt joins him when he finds out his father ( Michael Pare , of "Eddie and the Cruisers " ) took his tuition money to pay his gambling debts . Matt has other motives . His ex-girlfriend Arielle ( Odette Yustman ) headed down months before to kick off her modeling career . When Matt gets to town , he finds Arielle mixed up in Miami 's nightclub scene , dating Elizabeth 's son Alex ( Lee Thompson Young ) , the jealous , egocentric manager of the Hotel Soleil 's nightclub , Nocturnal . The real problem is the hotel 's minority partner , Robert Fuentes ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , who , in addition to being a businessman , is a player in the city 's organized-crime scene . A couple of fistfights put Matt in Elizabeth 's good graces , and wins Vincent a place in Robert 's heart . Each is hired on to watch the other 's boss , jobs that 'll eventually pit the best friends against each other . " South Beach 's " chances of making it on Wednesday night are slender at best , but if it succeeds , " Veronica Mars " fans should worry . The teenage detective may be staying on the air based on her prestigious track record with critics and "best of " lists ; however , all it takes is one more ratings success for UPN to devalue " Veronica .

NW	It may be as close as any Supreme Court nominee comes to feeling like a rock star . On the morning of the first day of Senate hearings on his Supreme Court nomination , Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. emerged Monday from the passenger seat of a dark SUV at the corner of Constitution Avenue and First Street at 11 a.m. to chants of , " Alito , Alito . " A conservative Christian group , TeenPact , tipped off by the Bush administration about the drop-off , assembled a group of 50 high school students with red A(PLUS) stickers on their lapels to cheer the arrival . Alito seemed almost to blush , smiling with tight lips and murmuring his thanks as he ducked into a Senate office building with a gaggle of administration escorts . But by the time of his own short opening statement just before 4 p.m. , a day of senatorial lecturing surely shook the nominee out of any delusions of grandeur . Sen. Charles E. Schumer , D-N.Y. , reminded him that a president is not a king . Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , hectored him about aborted fetuses " torn from the wombs . " " If Roberts was a 10 , he was an 8 , " Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C , who is on the Judiciary Committee , said after the session , recalling the dazzling performance of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at his confirmation hearings a few months ago . " He was nervous , " Graham said . " He was more human than Roberts . " Comparisons were inevitable even before Alito had his chance to speak . Roberts had appeared as a study in empathy in the opening statements at the start of his hearings , seemingly engrossed with every nuance of even the most rambling or self-referential comment from a senator . To emphasize his deep and genuine interest , he occasionally nodded as he took in their words . Alito , in contrast , sat stone faced and impassive , sometimes even tilting his head slightly backward , a pose familiar to people have watched his rounds of senators ' offices in the weeks before his hearings . When his turn came to speak just before 4 o'clock , Alito silently and deliberatively poured himself a glass of water before he began . " I have often asked myself how in the world did I get here ? " Alito said , setting up a joke . " And I want to try to answer that today , and not by saying that I came here on I-95 or on Amtrak . " Few people laughed . At times , his voice quavered slightly as he discussed his family and , briefly , his role as a judge . He recounted his father 's arrival from Italy as an infant and his self-propelled rise to become a researcher for the New Jersey Legislature . And Alito emphasized that his mother , a school principal , and his sister , a lawyer , had excelled in professions that " traditionally had been dominated by men . " His only harsh words were leveled at his alma mater , Princeton , which he called " a different world " even though it was 12 miles from his middle-class community . In the turmoil of the late 1960s and early '70s , he said , " I saw some very smart people and very privileged people behaving irresponsibly , and I could n't help making a contrast between some of the worst of what I saw on campus and the good sense and the decency of the people back in my own community . " As the session ended , advocates on both sides of the nomination streamed into the hallways to put their gloss on the events . The two sides said the first day had gone as expected and pronounced themselves pleased . Nan Aron , president of the Alliance for Justice , a liberal advocacy group , called the comments about Princeton divisive for reviving debates on the Vietnam War . Conservatives aimed at the accusations of Democratic senators . Wendy Long , general counsel of the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network , laughed that Sen. Richard J. Durbin , an Illinois Democrat on the committee , had juxtaposed a discussion of the collapse of the Sago , W.Va. , mine with a dissent by Alito in support of a mining company in a dispute on safety standards . " Chief Justice Roberts was responsible for Hurricane Katrina , " Long said , recalling talk of the storm aftermath at his hearing . " Whatever is the story of the day . " Alito 's day ended with a little of the feeling with which it began . At the end of his testimony , he weaved his way through fans , not screaming teenagers , but White House handlers , Republican senators and their aides .
NW	ankle at a cost of 3,000 pesos , or seven weeks ' salary . She also owes the friends who gave the coyote $ 500 . A month and a half earlier , Margarita Ximil Lopez , 20 , had her hopes dashed , too . She sat in a dismal holding cell at the United States Border Patrol station in Nogales in October and tried to hide her tears from her son , Edel , who is about to turn 6 . It was for his sake , she said , that she illegally crossed the border , only to be abandoned by the coyote and picked up at a motel by American immigration officers . Ximil , from Puebla , a large city southeast of Mexico City , had hoped to join her sister , who had lined up a job for her as a waitress in a Los Angeles restaurant . Here in Arizona , a tide of anti-immigrant sentiment has swelled along with the number of border crossers , some of it directed particularly at women . Many taxpayers say they resent that their tax dollars are being spent to educate these women 's children and pay for their delivery costs at local hospitals . Reacting to the surge in illegal border crossings , voters in Arizona passed Proposition 200 in November 2004 , which , among other things , requires people applying for some public benefits to show proof of citizenship . The economic reality of illegal immigration is complex . Whether these workers cost taxpayers more than they contribute has been debated for years , factoring in the taxes collected , the unclaimed Social Security funds and the undesirable jobs filled at low wages . (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. ) Pregnant women who are already in the United States illegally invariably use hospitals to give birth , though statistics are unreliable because emergency room patients are not asked their legal status . Children born in America are automatically granted citizenship , and some critics accuse the mothers of exploiting that guarantee . But advocates for illegal immigrants maintain that the women 's reasons for coming here reach far beyond citizenship for their children ; few women come to the United States expressly to have babies , collect benefits and visit the emergency room , the advocates say . Jim Hawkins , a Tucson sector Border Patrol agent , said such instances were rare but not unheard of . " I had a woman sit on the south side of the fence until she went into labor , then jumped the fence , " Hawkins said . " She was coached well : she immediately asked for an ambulance . " After she gave birth , the woman was ordered to return to Mexico . Rather than have her baby put up for adoption , Hawkins said , she took the baby back to Mexico with her . The nation 's roiling immigration debate weighs little on the minds of the women who cross here . Nor do the dangers of the crossing itself , which they know routinely include sexual harassment or assault . As the borders have become tighter , the coyotes have become more violent and desperate , law enforcement officials and immigration advocates say . " These poor aliens are nothing but product to these animals , " said Hawkins , adding that many women are raped , robbed and abandoned
NW	This city savors some pleasures not so much for what they are as for what they were . Thus the local esteem for the Hubig 's Pie , a glazed turnover of fried dough and fruit filling , sugary-sweet , palm-size , modest in its aspirations but , since the 1920s , unaltered . And , until Hurricane Katrina , never absent . But for four months now , New Orleans has done painfully without : Hubig 's lost half its employees and a third of its trucks , and returned to huge cracks in its ancient bakery . On Monday , the pies were back . All over town , any driver the Simon Hubig Co. could find walked into whatever grocery stores were open , bearing cardboard trays of pies , palm up . In darkness , they went forth from Hubig 's dilapidated converted stables on Dauphine Street on a quiet block in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood , with apple , coconut , pineapple , lemon and sweet potato ( made from fresh Acadiana yams , freshly boiled ) . The fat , jolly baker on the waxy white wrapper had returned . " Yay ! " said Shannon Alsherees , clapping her hands behind the counter as the Hubig 's man bustled into the Jetgo market on Magazine Street . " They 're going to be so happy to see that , " Alsherees said . " Since the day after we came back , they 've been asking . " The first customer in the store slapped a lemon Hubig 's on the counter , and Alsherees called out to the grumbling driver , " That 's all y 'all leaving us , that little bitty box ? " On another route in Metairie , a suburb west of the city , the story was identical . " People have been dying for them , " said Ann Moore , the manager at Danny and Clyde 's , a convenience store . " The people have been saying , ' Where is Hubig 's ? ' A lady said to me , ' What am I going to do ? ' So now they 're back , after four months . " One customer , a laborer in overalls , sidled up , eyed the delivery and commented , " Ah , the pies are back . " All by itself , in its cheeky package with its freckled , smiling chef , wearing a silly baker 's hat inscribed " Savory Simon " and jauntily holding a pie aloft on his thumb , the little pie encapsulates a part of the culture here . The intense localism , for one , helps explain it : the pies are distributed only in this area . The trucks do not venture farther because , as the owners like to boast , the pies have no preservatives . ( In the past , though , they were available on the Internet . ) And then , the pie , like the po ' boy ( a French bread sandwich stuffed with whatever you like ) , is a great marriage of form and function . A workingman 's everyday pleasure , it can be picked up for 89 cents at the corner hardware store , along with nails and quarter-round moldings . This is not haute New Orleans . But in the rougher world after Hurricane Katrina , that is only to the pies ' advantage . " Certain people would n't have wanted our pies , say , in their hospitals , " said Andrew Ramsey , a third-generation bakery operator who also works as a New Orleans police officer . " Post-Katrina , they 're happy to get what they can . " The Orleans Parish jail is traditionally one of Ramsey 's biggest customers , ordering thousands per week -- apple and lemon being the inmates ' favorites . In their history alone , the pies capture some essence of this city . They originated not here but in Fort Worth , Texas , an immigrant 's inspiration after World War I. Their creator , Simon Hubig , expanded his company in the 1920s to nine cities , mostly in the Southeast . All the bakeries eventually failed except the one here , where locals have fiercely supported it for decades . The pies have issued from the same spot since the early 1920s , pressed into the same shape , using the same cast-aluminum wheel . " I think it has to do with the diet of the New Orleanians , " Ramsey said . " You give them a little fried , glazed dough , and people around here are going to eat it . " Besides , at under a dollar , a pie is " a very reasonably priced commodity . " For generations of schoolchildren , a Hubig 's was the midday meal . Robert Oulliber , a Hubig 's vendor , said , " A lot of people who grew up here , they would skip the cafeteria , go across the street and buy a pie and a chocolate milk , and that was lunch . " Ramsey 's bakery did not flood during Hurricane Katrina , but the storm was tough on it in other ways . Damage to fleet and building aside , many of his employees were from the Ninth Ward and no longer have houses . Many customers are gone . In the final days of August , with the water in New Orleans rising , Ramsey loaded a truck with pies to hand out the bakery 's last production : 10,000 pies baked as the winds were gusting ahead of the storm . He pushed the truck a little too far into the water on that humanitarian , pie-distributing ride , and ruined it . Another truck was vandalized . Now Ramsey seemed delighted to be starting up again , despite the setbacks . " We lost people and we lost suppliers , but we 've rounded the corner , " he said . " We 've got a handful of dedicated people . " As for the missing customers , he said : " The people have migrated . We 're just going to have to find them . "
NW	The growth of national health spending slowed in 2004 , mainly because insurers reined in drug costs so that spending on pharmaceuticals increased at the slowest rate in a decade , the Bush administration announced Monday . Total health care spending rose 7.9 percent in 2004 , to $ 1.9 trillion , or an average of $ 6,280 a person , the administration said . That represents 16 percent of the nation 's economy , the highest share on record . Spending on prescription drugs rose 8.2 percent , to $ 188.5 billion in 2004 , the government said . This was the first year of single-digit growth in retail drug sales since 1994 . But spending on hospitals and doctors ' services surged in 2004 , and the nation spent far more on them than on prescription drugs . The 8.6 percent increase in spending for hospital care and the 9 percent increase in payments to doctors were the highest recorded since 1991 . The new figures do not reflect the cost of the Medicare prescription drug benefit , which took effect this month . Stephen Heffler , a government economist , has previously said that the benefit will have "only a minor impact on overall health spending , " but will redistribute costs so the federal government bears a larger share of drug spending . Cynthia Smith , an economist at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said the slowdown in drug spending resulted from greater use of low-cost generic drugs , in place of brand-name products ; increased use of mail-order services to dispense drugs ; and "reduced consumption of certain drugs " because of safety concerns . " U.S. health care spending grew more slowly in 2004 than in the three previous years , " Smith and three colleagues said in a report published in the journal Health Affairs . " Prescription drug spending has been the strongest factor in the slowdown in recent years . " Mark Merritt , president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association , said the new data vindicated the techniques used by members of his organization to manage drug spending . These companies , known as pharmacy benefit managers , include Caremark Rx , Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions . But , Merritt said , at the federal and state levels , "lobbyists for brand-name drugmakers , chain drugstores , trial lawyers and others are working to undermine many of the tools we have used to reduce the rate of growth in drug spending . " For example , he said , brand-name drug companies have resisted state laws that encourage the substitution of generic drugs . Andrea Hofelich , a spokeswoman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association , a trade group , said patients received generic drugs for 53 percent of the prescriptions filled in 2004 . But , Hofelich said , the costs were so much lower that those drugs accounted for only 12 percent of drug spending . Paul B. Ginsburg , president of the Center for Studying Health System Change , a private group that tracks health costs , said he took little comfort from the new data . The latest slowdown must be viewed in context , Ginsburg said . Health spending grew at abnormally high rates in 2001 and 2002 because consumers forced insurers to relax many restrictions of managed care , like rules requiring patients to get authorization from a primary care doctor before visiting a specialist . " The rate of growth in health spending slowed in 2004 , but it 's still substantially higher than trends in earnings , which are the key to being able to afford health care , " Ginsburg said . " Health insurance is becoming less affordable to more people . " As usual , health spending grew faster than the economy or consumer prices . The Consumer Price Index , a widely used measure of inflation , increased 3.3 percent in 2004 . (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. ) The government 's annual report on health spending , issued Monday , includes these highlights : -- Spending for hospital care totaled $ 570.8 billion . Hospital spending by private insurers rose 9.5 percent , while Medicaid spending on hospitals increased 9.9 percent . -- Spending for doctors ' services climbed to $ 399.9 billion in 2004 . Medicare spending on doctors rose 11.1 percent , up from an increase of 8.8 percent in 2003 . Doctors are performing more services and more complex services , for which they receive higher fees from Medicare . -- Payments to independent home health agencies have been rising more rapidly than any other category of health spending . They increased 11.1 percent in 2003 and 13.3 percent in 2004 , to $ 43.2 billion . Medicare spending for home care shot up 19.3 percent last year , partly because of rapid growth in home-based hospice services . -- Spending on care provided by skilled nursing homes rose 4.3 percent last year , to $ 115 billion . Medicaid accounts for 44 percent of that spending . The federal government has restricted the techniques states can use to finance their share of these Medicaid costs . Medicaid spending on nursing homes rose just 3 percent last year , compared with an increase of 5.3 percent in 2003 . Overall , public spending on health care grew faster than private spending in 2004 . Medicare spending , for people who are 65 and older or disabled , rose 8.9 percent in 2004 , to $ 309 billion , partly because of a new law that increased payments to health maintenance organizations and rural health care providers . By contrast , Medicaid spending grew 7.9 percent in 2004 , to $ 290.9 billion . Efforts to hold down drug costs slowed the growth in Medicaid spending , which was 11 percent in 2002 and almost 9 percent in 2003 .
NW	The decision to bring charges against 14 people here after a violent demonstration at the World Trade Organization conference last month is turning into a contentious and diplomatically sticky issue for the governments of Hong Kong , China and South Korea . Labor union federations and social justice groups , mainly from Asia and Europe , are portraying the 14 as "WTO political prisoners . " They held a small march here on Monday and said they had sent delegations to deliver letters , and in some cases hold demonstrations , at Chinese consulates and embassies in New York City and in Bangladesh , Belgium , Hungary , Thailand and Switzerland . All but three of the protesters charged after the demonstration are South Korean , and their case has drawn considerable attention at home , with three of the country 's most famous movie and soap opera stars issuing a recent appeal for their release . South Koreans are already resentful about China 's tough treatment of refugees from North Korea , many of whom have been repatriated to face long prison terms and even execution . The South Korean government has appealed to the Hong Kong government repeatedly to release the protesters , all of them men . But the Hong Kong authorities have refused , pointing out that the protest here on the night of Dec. 17 left 137 people injured , including 67 police officers . " Hong Kong is a place where the rule of law is strongly upheld , " said Wong Yan-lung , Hong Kong 's secretary for justice , after meeting here on Monday with three opposition lawmakers from South Korea who complained about the prosecution . " This case is being processed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and our established and announced prosecution policy . " Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 , but Hong Kong , which has 7,000 South Korean citizens , retains its own independent legal system . Huge democracy demonstrations here over the last two years have been completely peaceful , and government officials have expressed worries that local radicals might misinterpret leniency toward the protesters at the world trade meeting as a willingness by the government to tolerate violence . Lee Kyu-hyung , South Korea 's vice foreign minister , came here two days after the protest to express regret for the confrontation as well as to ask for the release of all detainees . The protesters have been charged with unlawful assembly , and officials have said they are considering other charges , including assaulting police officers . The protesters , 11 of whom began a hunger strike last Thursday , contend that they are all innocent and are victims of mistaken identity . Yang Kyung-kyu , the president of the Korean Federation of Transportation , Public and Social Services Workers ' Unions and one of the 14 protesters being prosecuted , said at a news conference here on Monday that the Hong Kong police lacked experience in distinguishing among people of Korean descent . Korean labor advocates said plans were being made to bring 300 protesters to Hong Kong on Jan . 20 and 21 if it has not dropped its plans to prosecute the 14 men . The police encircled the protesters on the night of Dec. 17 and arrested more than 1,000 of them the following morning . All except the 14 were released a day later . The 14 have been released on bail but have not been allowed to leave the territory , with the exception of one , a student from Taiwan , who was allowed to go home for exams after Taiwan 's government posted nearly $ 13,000 in bail , said Mabel Au , a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong People 's Alliance on WTO , which organized many of the protests here . The two others who are not South Korean are a man from Japan and one from the Chinese mainland . The next court hearing is scheduled for Wednesday .

Mr Blair is set to make a statement about the 7,000 British troops serving in Iraq at the Commons . The BBC 's James Landale said 1,500 troops were expected to return home in months , rising to 3,000 by Christmas . Downing Street has not confirmed the reports but Whitehall sources have told the BBC the process could be slowed down if the situation in Iraq worsens . here 's reuters covering the same story : Prime Minister Tony Blair looked set on Wednesday to outline a timetable for British troops to start withdrawing from Iraq , with media reports saying 3,000 soldiers could be home by the end of the year . Blair will tell parliament the gradual draw down comes as Iraqi forces take over more control of security in the south of the country , according to British newspapers and news channels . A spokesman at the prime minister 's Downing Street office declined to comment on the reports , but said parliament would be updated first on any announcement about Iraq . Confirmation of a pull-out plan would be symbolic for Blair , who is due to leave office later this year .

Today on Democracy Now ! the topic the New York Times runs from was addressed . Amy Goodman noted that , early on in the illegal war , Gallup polling found that 43 % of Iraqis thought the illegal war was about robbing Iraq of its oil . This was the introduction for a discussion of the privatization of the Iraqi oil industry that the US administration has attempted to push through repeatedly . Raed Jarrar has obtained a copy of the latest version of the proposed law and translated it . He emphasized three points : 1 ) Unfair , long-term contracts that can run for " thirty-five years and cause the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars from Iraqis " ; 2 ) Since Iraq will not be allowed to set production limits it " cannot be a part of OPEC anymore " but its production levels would instead by set by " the Federal Oil and Gas Council , that will have represantives from the foreign oil companies on the board of it , so representatives from , let 's say , ExxonMobil and Shell and British Petroleum will be on the federal board of Iraq approving their own contracts " ; 3 ) By bypassing the centeral government and giving authority to the provinces , it makes possible " splitting Iraq into three regions or even maybe three states in the very near future .

Not even becoming one , which would have doubled the sentence , just conspiracy to become one . He passed to the Cuban government various pieces of unclassified information and personal information on Cuban exile leaders . Iâm not sure how this constitutes a crime ( the prosecutor was allowed to say that the damage Alvarez may have done is unclear because we donât know what else he told Havana , which was an attempt to get the court to convict for uncharged crimes for which there was no evidence ) . But of course the trial was held in Miami , so Alvarez , and his wife , who was sentenced to 3 years merely for knowing what her husband was doing and not calling the FBI , were really tried and convicted for political crimes . The judge said their actions âundermined U.S. foreign policy .â  So ? He said they were âin a sense leading a double life , â  and that they had committed a âdeceit and betrayalâ  of the Cuban exile community . Which may not be very nice , but ... so ? Evidently US courts of law , at least in Florida , are now policing deceit and betrayal of the Cuban exile community . postCount ( '3-1-07' ) ;

WB	Fallujah looks pretty much like Munich . In 1945 .
WB	I think you can forgive yourself for using "in other words . " In your case it was to actually use other words in order to further elaborate the implications of the prior words . When Bush uses the phrase he does n't actually use other words , he uses the same words rearranged . In other words , were Bush to have used that phrase in this particular example , he would have said : " [Samarra] was designed to provoke retaliation ... And the result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal . In other words , the escalation of sectarianism resulted from an attempt to provoke retaliation . " And , if one wants to emulate Bush to the fullest : While uttering the latter element of that locution , it of utmost importance to chop the air with you hand and nod tendentiously as if you are revealing some truth that has hitherto been hidden from your audience , who are obviously constitutionally incapable of understanding statements of cause and event . Which , of course , would be different from being Constitutionally incapable of restraining imperial adventurism cause and event . In other words , [chopping air ] restraining the President via the US Constitution is not the same as understanding simple English .

WB	Alberto Gonzales called a press conference about the firings of those 8 US Attorneys , and the lies told to Congress about those firings , passive-voicedly acknowledged that âmistakes were madeâ  while refusing to admit that Congress was lied to ( â I believe very strongly in our obligation to ensure that when I provide information to the Congress that itâs accurate and that itâs complete , and I am very dismayed that that may not have occurred here â ) , insisted that the US attorneys were fired for being âweak performers ,â  absolved himself of responsibility ( âwhen you have 110,000 people working in the department , obviously there are going to be decisions made that Iâm not aware of in real timeâ ) , and uttered the most meaningless words a Bush cabinet official can ever utter : â I accept that responsibility .â  Wonkette asks , â Is Gonzales somehow the smuggest asshole in this administration ?

WB	The US military said that KSM confessed , and produced a transcript . I do n't consider that reliable evidence whatsoever that KSM confessed . And if he did all those things , should n't they let everyone else at Gitmo go free , since there is nothing left for them to have done ?

WB	Bush gave a little speech for the 4th anniversary ( 8 Friedman Units ) of the Old Iraq War , with a painting of Teddy Roosevelt , presumably in Cuba , behind him . He did nât spend much time on the Old Iraq War , which was initiated âto eliminate the threat [Saddam Husseinâs ] regime posed to the Middle East and to the world .â  He moves right on before you can ask , âWithout the WMDs you said he had , what threat was that , monkey boy ?â  Itâs another clean-slate moment for George , like quitting drinking and 9/11 . He wants us to forget the boring Old Iraq War and focus on the New Iraq War , the âBaghdad security plan .â  The New Iraq War is bright and fresh and , ya know , new , and is nât bogged down after four long years , no , itâs âstill in the early stages ,â  so what are you people being all impatient about ? It will âtake months , not days or weeks .â  So , 4 or 30 times longer . âIt can be tempting , â  he says , âto look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home . That may be satisfying in the short runâ  but blah blah contagion of violence blah safe haven blah blah .

WB	Staying with the crazies , the Giddiest Gabor in the Green Zone , little Willie Caldwell , grabbed his feather boa and marched before reporters to declare , " They 're arming the insurgents , dahling . " With the five Iranian diplomats still not released ( and US military command announcing today that they were n't going to be ) , Little Willie strutted and made broad statements . Or , as the BBC put it , "accused . " AFP also uses the ( accurate ) terminology , noting that Little Willie "accused the Iranians of training Iraqi groups on how to assemble explosively-formed projecticles -- a type of armour-piercing roadside bomb that has caused many coalition casualties . " Lauren Frayer , AP 's frequent embed , paid to write for a living , somehow fails to utilize "accused " once ; however , she did take down good stenography for Little Willie and deploy the term " said " eight times in a 300 plus word 'report ' ( 324 -- check my math ) . In other Press Shames , Joe Strupp ( Editor & Publisher ) reports what 's what at The Savannah Morning News these days . On their front page , they are now running a column by Major General Rick Lynch -- at least it may be by him . The paper 's editor , Susan Catron , asked of the names at the end of Lynch 's opinion column offers happily , " I ca n't tell if they wrote it or not . " Catron also reveals that the paper is not paying the general for his column . Hmmm . The editor ca n't state for the record whether or not the column was written by the general and this weekly column ( carried on the front page ) requires no payment to the writer ? For many , that would be enough to raise red flags but Catron 's still recovering from the mighty Sunday comics war that so drained the paper 's resources Strupp reveals that the newspaper staff believes ( and they are right ) that if the column belongs anywhere , it is "on the opinion page . . . Is this appropriate for a 50,000-reader newspaper that purports to be free from government influence ? Staff members feel it has undermined the newspaper 's credibility and independence . " Turning to news of attempts to increase leisure time , AP reports that the US " White House is considering naming a high-powered official to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and report directly to President Bush" . There seems to be some confusion here so let 's turn to the US Constitution , Article II , section 2 which reads : The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the Militia of the several States , when called into the actual Service of the United States ; he may require the Opinion , in writing , of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments , upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices , and he shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States , except in Cases of Impeachment .
