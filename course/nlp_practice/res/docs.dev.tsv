AA	For the guy with the broken front caster ( " How do I GET new casters for this shop vac... ? ) - I had the same problem ( except I had mine for several years before it broke ) and I called Shop Vac Customer Service at 570-326-0502 and they are sending me a new caster part kit gratis . The rep was very gracious , especially since she noted that my model ( 8045 ) was " a really old one " . I gave 3 stars because I was required to give a rating but I have an older product that is much more similar to the 925 but only 4.5 peak HP. It is incredibly loud - like a jet engine in your garage - hopefully the newer models are quieter .
AA	I ordered these because my Hoover calls for type " S" bags and they are quite hard to find in regular stores . It turns out that even though these are type " S" bags and they are made by Hoover , they do n't seem to fit my vacuum , and now my vacuum sucks and then spits . I think maybe I ordered the wrong thing .
AA	Works as advertised , and as your original filter did on the Holmes . It 's the same filter . Much better deal here than in the store , if you can even find it in a store .
AA	I used The Bissell Little Green with turbocleaner the first day I got it . Was I surprised ! The Little Green did everything it said it could do . I have used it several times since with great success . I would recommend this unit to anyone .
AA	I have been using my Eureka 5843 for over 7 years . The original belt just burned up this past week , and that was not because of poor design , or product quality . My wife drops the vacuum down to the lowest setting , meant to be used on hardwood floors and tiles , even on shag and pile rugs . After putting up with the added strain and friction caused by this type of use , the belt overheated and smoked , after 7+ years ! This is not the manufacturer 's fault , nor does it indicate poor quality on the vacuum or belt 's behalf . All equipment relies on the user 's ability to read and follow the included instructions .
AA	I got two falls out of this leaf-vac before the little male-plastic bar that holds the fan/hand unit into the blowers female part broke as I cleared the 20th jam of the day today and tried to hook the unit back together . Before it broke ...it was heavy even empty and bulky to maneuver . It jammed very easy at the narrow hole from the machine to the bag . The bag was always flying off my shoulder no matter how I adjusted the strap . I give it a positive review for the blowing action . It blows grass off the driveway and walkway good . When it was n't jamming it sucked very dry loose leaves up . It jams on bunches and god forbid there is a little moisture on them . Won't buy a B&D replacement .
AA	This slotted spoon , like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line , is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability , and flawless performance . Its ergonomic design , hefty body , and big , pressure-absorbing , non-slip grip , complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers , are the reasons why you 'll prefer this product over the more traditional models , as they will allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries . Its elegant , stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table , and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging , and a strong , stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable . Overall , this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables , fruits , shrimp and other foods , and its easy to clean , simple construction and dishwasher-safe , hard-wearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years . Furthermore , its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away . After submitting this product to over two years of normal , everyday use , mine is still just like new . --Reviewed by Maritza Volmar
AA	I bought this vacuum for use in my garage . I do little DIY jobs here and there , and I 'm trying to get into woodworking , so I needed a vac to clean up the sawdust and miscellaneous mess . I looked at reviews on vacuums in woodworking magazines , but could n't justify paying for the super high dollar vacs . Also , my father had a Shop-Vac while I was growing up that worked fine , so I did n't think I could go too wrong .<br> But I was mistaken . This is an expensive unit , and one of its draws is the auto function that allows you to plug a power tool into it and have the vac turn on when you fire up the tool . That part works . But it does n't shut itself off when you turn off the sander , saw , etc . When you have to fumble for the vac power switch after using the tool , I 'm not sure you 've saved yourself a whole lot by not having to fumble for it right before using it . But this is not my biggest gripe .<br>The biggest problem with this vac is it has little power and is easily clogged up . The other day I spilled some granulated lawn fertilizer on my garage floor . When I went to vacuum it up , this Shop-Vac sucked it up--but only as far as the hose ; the fertilizer never made it to the vacuum . I had to detach the hose and empty the fertilizer out into a gargage can . Afterwards I went around my shop vacuuming up sawdust and small debris . I could go about two minutes between having to pull apart the hose extensions or pull the hose straight to dislodge small ( about 3/4 " ) wood chips that had plugged up the vac. This Shop-Vac has only worked for me when I was vacuuming up dry sawdust containing absolutely no woodchips , no matter how small . Even then the attachments seem more suited for cleaning out the crevices in the seats of a car than for vacuuming up sawdust coating a garage floor . <br>The vacuum 's power cord is long , which could be a benefit , but I find it too long for use in my 1-1/2 car garage ; the vac just trips up over its own cord . The vacuum hose also is long , but readily coils up , pinching off the vacuum and killing off the suction . The hose is also inconvenient to store on the vac itself . Also , I think a larger diameter hose might be a big improvement , but then I would think the vac would need more power to accommodate . <br>This has been a big disappointment , unlike some other tools I have obtained for my shop , such as my Porter-Cable circular saw and DeWalt router combo kit . It 's bad enough that this tool does n't work very well ; it 's made only worse that it cost so much to boot .
AA	The juice extractor does FIT the 9 cup fp , as Kitchenaid says , however , it does n't actually WORK with it . The attachment sits in the bowl just as it should , it spins around , but the food pusher does not reach down far enough to actually make juice out of your veggies . Whatever you drop in will simply go straight through without scraping the bottom , as Kitchenaid says it should , and then spin around like mad without making juice . I spoke with Kitchenaid a couple of times and I am sending it back . I even tried putting in larger chunks but it just wo n't hold them in place because the pusher and tube extender are not long enough . I also tried a wooden spoon for a pusher but it did n't help due to the shortness of the tube . Bottom line , no matter how bad you want this extractor , like I did , do n't get it for a 9 cup processor .
AA	I bought this item for my daughter in law , as she was looking to make large quantities of fruit and veg sauces . She is happy with it and I thought the price was very good .
AA	Like the title says , I 'm giving this product a one star rating because there 's nothing lower . I bought this along with the KA mixer for myself for Christmas . Like one reviewer stated , this thing fails horribly on three points : The plunger has no seal , so the ground forcemeat just pushes back out instead of going down to the worm gear . The worm gear does n't seal either , so the plunger lets air into the chamber and the worm gear pushes it into the casing , creating air pockets in your sausage . The stuffer is too high above the worksurface . I wound up putting mine in a kitchen chair beside the counter and using textbooks to raise it to the right level . If you plan on making even moderate amounts of sausage , just do the smart thing and get a sausage stuffer . There is a very sturdy , highly recommended 5# model on the web , just search for stuffers and look in the $ 80 price range . There 's not one thing about this product that I can compliment , except maybe that it 's cheap enough that I do n't feel like I blew a lot of money on a piece of garbage .
AA	First let me say that I bought this re-usable filter based on user reviews and the idea that I could stop buying the paper filters . There are a few downsides to using this filter . When you have finished brewing the coffee there is a silt residue at the bottom of the pot . It is something akin to the stuff on the bottom of a tea pot . You will notice a strange metallic taste with this filter . You have to clean the filter after each use . Dumping the grounds in the trash can gets most of the grounds , but you have to rinse the filter to clean out the remainder . I 've had this filter nearly two months and I may go back to paper filters just to make sure the things I 've noted here are directly related to the Gold Tone Filter .
AA	Wonderful . Puts about 5 gallons of water into the air each day . No more static electricity !
AA	This product definately lives up to the humidifier side , but I found that it was only decent as an air purifier , not really measuring up to some of Bemis ' other fine products .
AA	I was pleased to find these trays to fit my FD-35 Nesco Deydrator . I never found them in a store . I have n't used them yet but I know they will be fine .
AA	I actually use these with a Rival Seal-a-meal vacumn sealer . They work great every time . They vacumn and seal easily . I 've even re-used bags three and four times . I hate to use more plastic , but love the results . I try to salve my conscience by making sure I recycle all the bags when they 're no longer usable . I 've tried using cheaper bags from Wal-Mart , and had nothing but trouble . The Rival seal-a-meal bags actually work fine too , they 're just harder to find .
AA	This is one powerful mixer . I ca n't imagine ever using the highest setting . I feel the low setting is even too much sometimes .
AA	We purchased a Hamilton Beach cool mist humidifier for our daughter . We go through one filter/month . The filters are not sold in any locals stores and we can only buy them on Amazon . We usually have to purchase ( 6 ) at a time because the filters smell moldy after 3-4 weeks . Now the price has jumped from $ 6.99/filter to $ 15/filter . We are disappointed with the product and it 's permformance .
AA	This blower does a good job blowing leaves . It does less well with the vacuum feature . If you try to vacuum leaves they tend to plug up in the intake . You can vacuum sawdust or particulate matter , but not nearly as well as a shop vac. It 's a good leaf blower .
AA	I like that this hangs on the wall and is out of the way in the garage . The power is good for most applications ; car clean out or garage vacuuming . Easy to operate , easy to use .
AA	I loved mine for a year that it worked . After about 6 uses and just less than a year , while making a cake the handle finally broke ! I was thinking of replacing it with another Kitchen Aid $ 10 spatula , but why should a spatula last only 1 year and cost $ 10 ? They look super cool with the silver trim , but they do n't seem to be well-made . I will have to research a NON-KitchenAid spatula because this one does not make the grade ! I am moving on to another brand .
AA	My family loves old fashioned , real milk shakes . This product works like a dream and I made a perfect milk shake on the first attempt . It is sort of big and I was trying to find a place to store it in my kitchen and my family laughed . Keep it on the counter , they said , it wo n't be worth your time to put it away ! It is worth every penny ! ! !
AA	I 've had a Fein Turbo II vacuum for several years now and I like it a bunch . But , I have never liked emptying and cleaning it , especially the hassle of cleaning the original cloth liner . Now with this kit installed I get better filtration , excellent suction and easy emptying . The dust bag is surprisingly large . I 'm sure I will end up changing it more often than I cleaned the unit before simply because it is so much easier to do . Even so , I doubt I will go through more than three or four bags per year in my use . The extra expense is worth it both for convenience and for minimizing the amount of dust in the air . I 'm constantly battling with dust in my woodshop for obvious reasons . This helps ! My only complaint is that there are absolutely no instructions included with the kit . Luckily it is n't hard to figure out , but you would think that they could have tossed a simple one page instruction sheet in the box .
AA	I insert a push pin into the lid . Put some tape over it , I use the black electrical tape , fold over the end so you can pull up easily each time . You can do this over and over , no need to try and pry open the lid with a spoon and possibly bend the lid . Works great ! I use this jar sealer more than the bags . In fact , I only had a few rolls left when I bought a large box of bags at Costco about 6 months ago . Have n't even opened that box yet ! I mostly use the bags for freezing meat .
AA	I would rate this a " 0" , but it was n't an option available . I never got a decent batch of ice cream out of this product . Just a soupy mush . Tried multiple different recipes and even ran 2 separate trials with this machine next to my original ,very tired Oster machine . The worn out machine made a great batch , this one , zilch .
AA	Dirt Devil Type F Vacuum Cleaner Bags ( 10-Pack ) I usually purchase these bags locally at twice the price . Am I ever happy to have found this resource . Genuine Dirt Devil bags - fit great , work great . I recommend highly .
AA	This is the newest of 3 hand mixers I own . But I must say , it is the one that sits out on my countertop and now gets most of the use . The 2 speed feature is great . The low speed allows you to blend in bulky foods progressively then the high speed purees nicely and efficiently . I hope you enjoy using yours as much as I enjoy using mine .
AA	I was very disappointed with this product . Sanyo Dirt Hunter had so much problem picking up small , light pieces of paper off a hard wooden floor . Do not expect to get much cleaning out of this vacuum . You 'll be much better off getting a mop .
AA	Both of these belts broke on the first day . The previous belt had lasted over a year . I thought these would be better , since their labeled as Extended wear . I picked up some cheap ones ( not Eureka brand )at walmart , and they are fine . I guess EXT means extra thick , which also means less pliable . Maybe it was just a bad batch , but I 'll stick to off brand from now on .
AA	I searched for , found , and ordered a Hoover quality filter . In returned I received a cheap , unwrapped , generic filter with a poor quality filter media . Furthermore , the filter was wrapped in an arabic newspaper . This is the ultimate bait & switch . I will never order from this company and again and would encourage Amazon to remove them from their site .
AA	Great hand blender for making baby food . We originally started with a traditional blender which was harder to get the food smooth and much harder to clean . This hand blender makes baby food in a snap and is easy to clean . It is also great for traveling as it easily fits into a suitcase . Highly recommend instead of a traditional blender for making baby food .
AA	I truly hate this vacuum that my husband bought because it looked 'cool ' while it worked on both carpet and hardwood floor . Here is a short list of why : 1 . The belt that rotates the brush keeps slipping off . After 10th time , my husband threw his hands up in utter defeat . 2. I have difficult time dragging the canister part while vacuuming . So many times , you are limited to the length of the flex hose connecting the two parts . It gets frustrating after third time stopping to drag/carry the canister . 3. The main brush/vacuum part does n't stand on its own . So when I stop to bring the canister closer , I have to place it on the floor . My back gets a lot of workout for the day . For the most part , the vacuum stays in the closet because I dread using it . My cordless vacuum has been overworking for our family with couple of dogs and a toddler for now . If you are considering buying this , please go to your local store so if it does n't work out for you , too , you can easily return the product .
AA	Save your money and buy another brand . This hand held does n't have the suction to pick up anything . Well maybe very little dust bunnies . My neighbor bought it and it did n't work for her . She gave it to me to see if perhaps I could get it to work . If I would have bought this product , I would have returned it the next day ! ! ! !
AA	Oh snap ! ! ! ! This is NOT the Eureka 3670 " Mighty Mite " ! It certainly is yellow enough , and the " Mighty Mite " is what I thought I was buying . Alas , I brought this dud home instead . I live in a two-story townhouse and replaced the dated linoleum with ceramic tile in my kitchen , 1/2 bath , and hallway/entry last summer . I also tore out the ugly carpet in the living room and dining room and installed hardwood floors . Upstairs , I ripped out the cheap carpet in the master bedroom and replaced it with Pergo . Thus----I now have carpet in the two spare bedrooms , the upstairs hallway , and staircase . Now that much of my home has hard surface flooring , I figured I could give my good upright to my needy sister and get an inexpensive canister vacuum to handle the few rooms with carpet as well as the area rugs in the other rooms . With Eureka 's " Mighty Mite " I probably could have , but with this dud I can do nothing but suck up dust balls under the furniture . There simply is minimal suction power ! ! ! The tiny , fist-sized bag fills up to maximum in almost no time at all , so be ready to purchase new bags within a few weeks after purchase . I wish I could recommend this to folks who have ONLY hard surface floors and need a small vacuum for their area rugs , but this thing wo n't even lift more than a feather from the surface of the carpet . As it is , I 've tucked it away in the corner of my bedroom closet and use it to suck up dust in the corners of the room ( Pergo floor ) . That 's it ! That is all it can really do . Final solution ? I went out and bought another Eureka " The Boss " upright to handle the rooms with carpet and the area rugs in the other rooms . As for the pathetic , yellow junk box hiding in my closet , it will certainly be featured in my annual yard sale .
AA	Item does what is says it will do , easy installation . Would buy this again , would recommend to anyone .
AA	I use this Vacuum for my auto detailing company . It is compact , powerful , easy to clean out and comes with a lot of useful attachements . The hose is flexible and well made . I will br buying more of these . : ::Edit : : : Unit breaks faster than my $ 70 vacuums from home depot , I have two of these and both are busted . The case , which is made of metal and feels very solid has clips that break after a while and wo n't hold the top on . Also , if you step on the hose , it bends permanently and does n't work as well and clogs after that .
AA	This corning ware product is great for individual servings . I 'm very busy so often cook on sunday for the week . I put about 8 servings into these dishes and freeze for the week . If I 'm too tired to fix something when I get home I pull a meal from the freezer and it 's ready to go . I do n't like to reheat in the microwave in plastic . I think this is a much healthier alternative . They are also the perfect size for one serving . They are sturdy and last just about forever incuding the cover . I have n't had the same luck with other products . They would be a little difficult to use for an older adult however because the top on the newer version is more difficult to remove . CorningWare Pop-Ins 8-Piece Oval Bake and Serve Set I 've used them for several years and they are my first choice for my busy life style .
AA	The original Corningware cookware has n't been manufactured since the late '90 's after the brand was sold to another company . The original could be used on top of the stove , under the broiler , and in the freezer . The new company altered the cookware and eliminated the flameware properties and begin production of the Corningware products that we have today . According to the Corningware website , these products can still be placed in the freezer , but are not to be used on the stovetop or under the broiler . However , the use and care guide for this dish does not mention anything about freezer use or from freezer to oven use . It says pretty much that the Corningware stoneware bakeware can be used for baking , serving , and re-heating food . I intend to go by the instructions in the guide and not use mine in the freezer . I just bought the 1 1/2 & 2 1/2 oval baking dishes . I also have the au gratins , and the round souffle French White dishes , which I have had about 6 years . Being curious about the comments about the coarse and gritty ridge piece under the bottom of the oval dishes , I took a peek and saw that it 's just an unglazed piece of ceramic that is probably there for heat diffusion or to prevent the bottom of the dish from getting scratched up , maybe both . The unglazed piece is not gritty and certainly not rough enough to scratch up countertops and tables . Mine are n't anyway . Having said all of that , I really like my Corningware pieces , and I think they perform very well for their intended purpose as bakeware . My older pieces are still like new , free from chips or rough edges . I always spray mine with a little cooking spray before using them so even baked on cheese is easy to remove . I bought the plastic and glass lids , which have to be purchased separately , unless buying a set , so I could have the glass one for baking use , and the plastic one when storing the food in the fridge . If interested in ceramic bakeware that can be used in the oven as well as under the broiler then this is not the cookware to purchase . The Emile Henry and Le Crueset lines would be better suited to meet those needs . For those looking for bakeware that can be taken from the oven to the table at an affordable price , then I recommend the Corningware line which includes a variety of pieces , sets , and colors to choose from .
AA	Up here in the deep north it is essential to have humidifier if you have musical instruments , or anything made out of nice wood . I have tried several different options , and evaporative humidifiers are the best . This one has enough nice features to warrent an excellent rating . The main great feature is that it is easy to add water to the system . The tanks remove easily , and can be filled from the kitchen sink ( they are too tall for filling in a bathroom sink ) . In the dead of winter expect to fill it daily , but fortunately this is big enough to only need filling once per day . Other nice features include a fan speed control ( pump humidity in fast because you were gone all weekend and its dry ) , or quiet . At low speed settings you barely know its on . I also like the optional air cleaning evaporator . It apparently slows down air flow , but that seems trivial since the fan can simply be turned up .
AA	This product is especially useful in whipping egg whites in a flash . Easily attatches . Able to be cleaned in the dishwasher .
AA	...for a weenie like me ! Seriously , it is light and easy to maneuver , it is versatile , and it has POWER we did not expect in a " stick-vac . " I have Multiple Sclerosis , and live with a 90-yr-old . Can't make that up ! We both use the B&D 3-in-1 often and with ease . It arrived from the vendor almost immediately .
AA	I did a lot of homework before deciding to buy this bad boy . I am not a vacuum expert nor do I really vacuum . I bought this as a Mother 's Day gift for mama-dukes . Well , what I heard from her was that this was by far the best vacuum she had ever used , and not simply because I bought it for her for Mother 's Day . This thing is very quiet compared to any vacuum I 've ever heard in our house . I do n't even hear it when I am in a different room . It is so quiet that it deceivingly feels a little weak . But it is ANYTHING but weak . . specially when you turn on the spinning motor thingie ( it gets a little louder with that on , but not so bad . ) MY GOD , this thing sucks up EVERYTHING ! Not in a bad way where it destroys your carpets or eats your cat , but in a good way that it really digs up dirt in between the carpet and makes vacuuming a joy and extremely effortless . Oh and if you were wondering how it punched my mom in the face . . well , while she was vacuuming under my bed , she bent down for a second to get something and the vacuum spinner thing was on and it sucked up her hair , lifted up off the floor and smacked right into her face . The funny( ? ) thing was , she could n't reach the off switch on the handle to turn off the motor ! We all had a good laugh about it and she had a bloody lower lip for about a week . My poor mom . She has a great sense of humor though . . she laughs every time she tells the story . Anyway , GREAT vacuum. . buy one !
AA	I bought this set a little over a year ago - not for the "dishwasher safe " feature , but the reviews were good and it seemed to be a good value . We never put them in the dishwasher , but the most used pieces( pans )seem to be losing their "non-stick " quality and luster . I would look elsewhere in the future .
AA	I bought this humidifier when i had my baby . It gets moldy , slimy and you have to clean it out after every other use . I also find that it emits a horrible odor as well like mildew if you do not change the water in the bottom tray too often . Dont feel that it is great to have my child breathing this in . GET SOMETHING ELSE.
AB	When I first got this book , my blood sugar had leveled-out at about 300. I just could n't lower my blood sugar , no matter how well I ate or how much I exercised . All my doctor could or would do was change my medication and order more tests for me . I did n't have medical insurance and I could n't afford any more tests , or even doctors ' visits ; so I stopped seeing my doctor .<br> In this book , I was firmly advised NOT to exercise until my blood sugar was below 250 ; otherwise my body would react to the exercise by releasing even more sugar into my blood . After I stopped the exercise my blood sugar did start to slowly drop . I then carefully read the book from cover to cover , and gained a large amount of very useful information .<br> I also began doing " Tai Chi for Diabetes " , which also appears to have helped .<br> Within a few weeks my blood sugar level dropped below 110 . I then discontinued the medication my doctor had given me . For over a week now my blood sugar has been below 107 ; without taking any pills .<br> I 've read a few other books on Diabetes , and they were all somewhat helpful ; but " The Mayo Clinic on Managing Diabetes " was by far the most helpful and informative book I 've read on the subject . I strongly recommend it .
AB	If you stick it through the 30 days you 'll break through something for sure . I had a noticable improvement by the end . This workbook is good for keeping you focused on journaling and developing the skills of asking yourself the right questions .
AB	If you have a power meter this book will make sense out of all the numbers , will give you real insight in the newest training way out there . Very technical book , but easy for the layman to understand . Will please 99 % of the racers out there .
AB	Coupled with Hans Richter 's : " Dada , Art and Antiart " and movement 's philosophy and works are clearly understood . Graphics are truly great and commentary enlighten . It might be noted this book is German published as the Max Ernst book " Life and Work" . Both with numerous colored plates of the highest quality . The Dada book though excels in text .
AB	I love this book . Reich explains in great detail how progressive ideas and ideals are the true hope for America and how the conservative , regressive programs of the right-wing are bad for America . He uses examples , gives details , explains things . It 's really a wonderful read . That said , you probably have to be a real political junkie to really enjoy it . At times , it 's kind of dry reading . Then again , if you picked up the book in the first place , you probably already ARE a political junkie . This book offers essential ammunition for combatting the right-wing smear mearchants who prefer to talk in sound bites and remember the good old days of " separate , but equal . "
AB	As pointed out by several other reviewers , this book is a sequel to the earlier and better Imperial Grunts . Kaplan revisits some of the locales of the earlier book and reports tremendous progress in places like Columbia and the Philippines . He spends time on a nuclear carrier , a destroyer and a nuclear fast attack submarine . Those were the best parts of the book . He spends time with A 10 pilots on deployment to Thailand and provides well-deserved credit to these blue collar fighter pilots who fly the unloved but tremendously valuable attack aircraft . It was so unloved by the fighter mafia that runs the US Air Force that they were going to retire the plane . The Army , which depends on air support , and has no air wing of its own like the Marine Corp , offered to take over the plane and add it to its own air arm . The Air Force quickly restored the A 10 units to full flying status and no more was heard for a while about retiring them . Kaplan does travel a lot and the depth of his interviews in the earlier book is n't here but it is still a good source of information about the far flung US military as it fights the savage wars of peace .
AB	As a long time WWII history buff I can recommend this book without reservation . The author has researched this book very well and presents the facts in a compelling fashion . I was expecting certain passages to regarding how the Japanese-American population at home was treated to be one of finger-pointing , over-sentimentalization and playing the victim to gain sympathy . Boy was I wrong . Negative aspects of "exclusion" , internment , and racism , are on the page but so are the bravery and resolve of these people to overcome them . The removal of the Japanese-American population from the west coast of the mainland while leaving the population of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii intact is spelled out in a way for the reader to discover the idiocy in it . For instance the reason given to the "evacuation " was the proximity of Japanese-Americans to military bases and facilities . Yet one of the future members of the 442d worked at Pearl Harbor helping to repair the facilities in the weeks and months after the attack ! This book brings to light a story that should be read .
AB	Whatever you do , dear reader , do not read this book straight through . Attempting this will introduce you quite early in your reading to the logical fallacy known as the Binary Nature of All Assertions , which ( mis )states that anything & everything is either true or false . The first puzzle resides in an ambiguous state , which , per se , is fine by me . Too bad the authoring logicians disagree , arbitrarily choosing one of these states from the ether for their so-called solution . I give this book 5 stars not in spite but , rather , because of this failing . For not all books carry their utility in their logic . This book would make a wonderful practical joke gift to a friend or , perhaps , an enemy . But never claim to have solved every puzzle in the book , for someone might realize on puzzle 1A , if they have a brain , that you do n't have a brain . Another use would be to give this book out to the youth of a generation & make them despise this thing they do n't get called logic , tempting them into the soft arms of faith , & saving them into the kingdom of heaven where reigns a god whom none have seen but all believe . In short , having mastered the logic of this book , I give it a 5 !
AB	Make sure you ask for pictures of the item as "brand new " does not mean it is in "brand new " condition . the book I received stated it was "brand new " and was ripped , the pages were turning yellow . obviously not brand new condition .
AB	The premise of the book is quite interesting : A guy disappearing 10 years ago and calling each mother 's day . As the story unfolds , there is very little police insights or technical details besides some explanations on tower tracking of a bunch of pre-paid phones around the big apple . I felt the story deserved more research and details .
AB	Simply geniusly told , it 's amazing how someone can come up with such a story-riddle . Is it four stories or is it one story ? Certain to spark discussions as one hint after the other reveals a little more . A book unlike any other . Smart and fun entertainment . Beautifully illustrated . David Macaulay at his best .
AB	I got a copy of this book from a friend . It was the right size ( ~250 pages ) for me to be able to have a hope to read it cover to cover . When i started going through the lessons and labs , i realized that seemingly hard topics in T-SQL suddenly became trivial . I got more out of these 250 pages , than a few of the 1000 page 'bible ' books i bought .
AB	to encourage single parent is sinful , the child not having a father is against nature , dont wasre your money on this one
AB	A 2nd helping of Chicken soup for the soul is a beautiful , beautiful , book . Just a minute ago I read reviews for the first book , and I was apalled at what some people wrote . I do n't know how people could be so insensitive that they should not be moved by such a wonderful book . I first read the Chicken Soup for the Soul books one day two years ago when I was sitting in my living room , trying to think of something to do . I spotted those books , and decided to try one of them . I read my first story and found myself almost in tears . I was truly moved by the kindness of one person . I spent the rest of the day reading the books , and by the end of the day I had resolved to try and show the kindness I had read about in those books . Today I feel I am a better person because of those books . I reccomend them to any kind of soul !
AB	I know for me I Can Stand to Blessed ! I felt as if the book was talking to me and I needed someone to write the words down for me to read . Thank God for Bishop T. D. Jakes . I ca n't get enough of his books . Get God and Get ready to be Blessed ...
AB	When I pick out a module , my biggest gripe is that the majority of novels are n't well thought out and therefore have plot holes or illogical maneuvers . <p> In order to get around this , I usually pay attention to the game designer credits to up my chances of getting a good piece . But , that does n't always work so I like to be able to flip through the item .<p>DRAGON MOUNTAIN is broken up in to three books with illustrious maps and score cards . The first book lays out the overland adventure and certain parts do n't make sense and are probably there to beef the party up .<p>However , the module makes up for this shortcoming in that the second and third books are put together quite well . This is a perfect example of where you can use very weak monsters , give them terrain and trap advantages with lots of magic and they can easily mess up party members . It can also be humiliating to the PCs if that turns you on as a DM. :D<p>The leader at the end of the story is tough and intelligent . Creators actually took the time to explain her battle strategies rather than rely on the DM figuring it out .<p>The fact that this mountain can shift from plane to plane makes it easy to fit in to any campaign . If , for some reason , your PCs are higher level , put a tougher race in place of kobolds and beef up the leaders .<p>Overall , the idea of weak monsters being able to take on midlevel and high level adventurers is a keen concept . Most DMs toss such creatures out when the PCs get to a certain level . This boxed set rejuvenates a weak race like kobolds . For that reason alone , I rank it five stars as great .<p>SOHP
AB	I highly recommend this audio tape to people who are trying to incorporate meditation into their lives . Dr. Borysenko has a very soothing voice and the exercises are effective . I think this tape may be especially appealing to women ; there is some content that I know some men may find corny . However , I found the both the breathing exercises and the stretching to be relaxing and very beneficial .
AB	If you are a man and are experiencing difficulty while trying to empty your bladder , getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom , or who has the urgent and sometimes painful need to urinate , your prostate may be trying to send you a message . If you have pain in your private parts , especially after having sex or urination , be sure to consider the possible source of the referred pain as the prostate . Prostatitis ( inflammation and or infection in the prostate ) can make a man miserable . Benign Prostate Hyperplasia ( BPH) , better known as enlarged prostate , affects most men eventually and accounts for one of the most frequent reasons of surgery on men each year . Finally , prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men . All of these subjects and more are handled deftly by Dr. Morganstern and Dr. Abrahams , who have written a book that is easy to understand and emminently useful . If you are looking for answers and resources this is the book to get . Even if you are already seeing a urologist , you need this book ! If you are having problems with your prostate , or want to learn what to do to prevent them , or are a concerned partner wanting to help and support the man in your life , I highly recommend this book . As a man who once suffered from untreated prostatitis and middle lobe hypertrophy , I wholeheartedly endorse this book . It may save your sanity and could certainly save your life .
AB	this author is funny , sexy , creates a background that never lets you down--i have read many of her books and will continue to do so . make sure you have all night to finish because the suspense is gripping .
AB	I was lucky enough to take this author 's class with my son in KC. After a few months of signing to him , he began signing nonstop around age 11 months . It helped immensely to reduce his frustration ( and mine ! ) in communicating his needs and wants . He learned new signs quickly and his vocabulary/recognition of new objects grew immensely in the months to follow . Now that he is 2 , his verbal skills are highly advanced ( he speaks very clearly and can compose complex sentences ) , and I firmly believe this is due to the strong language base he started with the signing programs . The songs and games in this book are still some of his favorites ! Glad to see this great resource is available to parents everywhere ! Thanks Anne !
AB	I found this product to be very helpful as a reference tool for term papers .
AB	Four people meet on New Year 's Eve on the top of a tall building with the same goal in mind . But because of a lack of privacy , they cannot jump . Instead , they agree to spend the next 90 days as semi-friends until they determine whether they really want to go through with it . These are four very different people , and each gets a shot at telling the story from his or her own point of view . The problem is that none of it really gels or becomes a real story--it just feels like a novelty act , a "what if " scenario that never grows legs .
AB	A wonderful second edition in this series of three books . D. Woolley easily wraps the fictional characters in with the real historical figures , so much so that you sometimes forget that you are reading a fictional book . This edition continues to follow Aaron , the Blacksmith 's son , and Rebekah , the Potter 's daughter , and their love . Aaron heals with Nephi 's family the whole time still believing that Rebekah has died . We are introduced to the people of Fort Lakhish , who add mystery and adventure to the story . We , also , see Zoram , an employee of Laban , and Elizabeth , the Blacksmith 's daughter grow closer . While Daniel , the Blacksmith 's second son and guard to Laban , move farther from his family and into the clutches of Laban 's evil . Hopefully D. Woolley can keep up the suspence in the third edition .
AB	The Hungry Planet is most familiar for the photos of some thirty families from very different cultural traditions , each posed with a display of their week 's supply of food . The book elaborates on this with many photos of the families at home , at work , at play , in the kitchen , at the market , in the garden . The accompanying reading enhances the experience but is not so extensive as to interrupt the pictures which are the main attraction . It 's a wonderful book to share with anyone but especially with youngsters who are old enough to appreciate the variety of human tastes and experiences .
AB	This is a beautiful book that encourages children to learn about their world . Information is provided in bits , making it easy for children to digest . In addition , the internet links provide unlimited learning on the topics in the book . As far as the person who complained that they showed a photo of NYC without the World Trade Centers , I think you need to be aware that the book was published in 2002 and the WTC no longer was there , nor will ever be there in the future . Do n't we need to depict the here and now truth in our books for children ?
AB	I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift a couple years ago ( he is a hip hop head ) and it is seriously his favorite book . He loves going through the different studios and it seriously inspires him . A lot of the producers in there are not mainstream and he loves that .
AB	" The Tsunami Quilt " is a touching story for old and young alike . While the tragedy of the 1946 Hawai'i tsunami is described , the story ( for me , anyway ) is mainly about the love shared between a grandfather and his grandson . This would be a perfect read for anyone who suffers from tragedy of any kind . It is a reminder that while life goes on , honoring the memory of a lost loved one helps us cope and heal .
AB	Lovely book with pictures that will stir memories in the hearts of all native Washingtonians and those who wish they were !
AB	An outstanding strategy book that challenges Porter Competitive startegy . It sets new dimension of open the market place and makes the competition un-relevant
AB	I found this book in the dollar store over the past weekend . I 've read through the book and found it enjoyable : Common-sense approaches to business that can be distilled in a few easy lessons . The chapters are short , the points of which are illustrated by vignettes peppered with familiar entertainment industry names . It comes down to this : Be true to yourself , work hard , treat people the way you 'd want to be treated , and do n't underestimate your enemy . Overall , a worthwhile and entertaining reading experience .
AB	An easy read from the begining . IT details events that shaped the pathway to World War II and the rise and fall of the Third Reich and how they managed to defeat themselves . It also proves a EXTREMLY important point as to the reason why we SHOULD get invloved in foreign affairs and not let them escalate . It discusses how Hitler wanted to shape Europe into his empire and how backstabbing the Russians were and so forth . It is detailed in a lot of places but I would have preffered more pictures and a little more details in some aspects . I recommend this book to anyone either just getting into the events of World War II or need some more facts about it .
AB	Last semester , I had the bad luck to get stuck in a statistics class taught by a nice , but thoroughly incompetent , professor . I seriously believed I was going to either have to drop the class or risk failing it , because nothing that was taught to us made any sense ( and our textbook was an abysmal failure too ) . In desperation I sought out alternative sources of information , and came across this book . It managed to transform the disastrous notes I had into something coherent . I relied heavily on this book over the instruction and text , and managed to achieve an " A" in a class that was otherwise doomed to a " C" at best . The book unfortunately does n't cover 2-way ANOVA or non-parametric testing , but if the author ( hint hint ) were to write a follow-up stat book covering more advanced topics , you can be sure I 'd purchase it .
AB	The pages are very choppy and uneven . Better off just getting a paperback if you need the book , or investing in a better quality hardcover
AB	As I read the reviews of others for See Jane Hit , I noticed that the reviewers came from either the academic side of the fence or the "in the field " side of the fence . I would like to offer a perspective from both sides in the hope that we can look at Garbarino 's work from a more balanced perspective . Having taught graduate counseling courses since the 1970 's and being a contemporary of Dr. Garbarino , I can tell you that his research skills and body of work in the field of adolescent psychology is highly respected by academia . Both Lost Boys and See Jane Hit are considered classics in the field . I had training with Dr. Garbarino in 2008 , and can say that he has consistently updated the statistics that continue to show a marked increase in violence among girls . Also , having worked in K-12 public education for over 30 years ( and for the last ten in a program for at-risk adolescents ) , I can attest to the fact that violence among girls is increasing just as Dr. Garbarino warned . But , past the "warnings , " go to the suggestions regarding "what we can do about it " and read carefully how he outlines the positives . It is actually a "hopeful " book from a professional who has made his life 's work the positive development of adolescents !
AB	I read the library 's copy of this book . It had so much information that I wanted to share with friends and family and remember for myself that I decided to add it to my small reference collection .
AB	Far from revealing any " secrets " , this book reads like a minimally organized pastiche of historical snippets commonly acccessible to any grade school student researching Paris . The entire text is compsed in jejune paragraphs as if the author himself could n't even stay interested enough to sustain any intellectual progression of thought . If there is anything postive to be said about this deceptively titled book it is that its inadequacies can serve to encourage interested readers to pursue further information in other books or resources . " Ah , Paris ...your 'secrets " are still out there waiting to be discovered and savored ! "
AB	Found this book to be boring and elementary . I unfortunately did not find this book sexy and the fact that it was listed as erotica was very disappointing . Book seemed like an inappropriate book for a ten year old . ick .
AB	Much more than an atlas , this is a big , ornate cathedral of a book . I came across Biblica in the reference section of my public library . I was so taken with the book , I bought two copies to give to my pastor and favorite Bible study teacher . Written by a team of distinguished academics and Bible scholars , Biblica includes 650 high quality color images of paintings , sculptures and scenic photographs . There are 125 maps , some of them spanning two full pages , showing prominent locations , journeys , battles , kingdoms and empires discussed in the Bible . For example , page 167 shows a full page map tracing possible routes the Israelites may have taken on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land . The first 89 pages include extensive sections on the development of the Bible , Bible archeology , and the geography and history of Bible lands . From there the book explains the geography , history , and cultures of the Bible chronologically , every page adorned with stunning artwork , illustrations , maps and photographs . The back of the book includes informative tables , extensive family trees , a bibliography and glossary .
AB	I absolutly recommend this book . Everyone should have a copy , specially parents . Too bad Amazon doen't have The food doctor for babies and children . I 'd love to buy it ! Teresa G.
AB	The book presents a realistic description of the extreme hardships endured by Army Nurses in Italy during WWII .
AB	I am the stepfather of three kids , and I read this book at the advice of my wife when we were having trouble with my kids and her kids ... and the relationship between them ... and reading Cohn 's book really helped me understand some of the things that were going on with them and how I should react to them . Reading it helped me figure things out that I never would have if I had n't . Definately a must-read for all stepfamilies .
AB	I 'm sorry I do n't share the enthusiasm of previous reviewers about this book . I borrowed it at the library because I liked the cover ( by the way , I looked in vain in the book for a reference to the jacket illustration ) and I was intrigued to read a plot about Justinian 's and Theodora 's court . I found the book hard to read because it 's not well written ( and has many typos ) , it 's difficult to get attached to any single one of its many characters , and the style of the descriptions really failed to put me in the picture . Three religions are "described " in the book : Orthodox Christianity , Heretic Christianity , and Mithraism , but you 'll be hard pressed to know what each stands for after reading THIS book ... I finished reading it only because I was hoping it would get better in the end--no such luck !
AB	Henty , that scarily prolific writer of historical "boy 's books , " is splendidly fun reading and may be quite different from your expectations . Though this novel begins rather poorly , with various tortured exposition-heavy conversations and stilted dialogue , it improves rapidly and actually gets quite suspenseful in its last third . A " story of the times of Hannibal " but not the story of Hannibal , the novel follows the first three major battles--all victories--of the Second Punic War : the Trebia , Lake Trasimene , and Cannae . Although Hannibal is a character and appears in several scenes , the novel centers around the "young Carthaginian " Malchus , a cousin of Hannibal serving as a captain in his army . Malchus ships out with his fellows who believe in Hannibal 's fight against Rome ( contrasted with the self-serving , pacifist and greedy policy of Hanno " the Great , " a powerful statesman in Carthage ) and demonstrates his courage and ability in a variety of actions , including the three battles above but also the siege of Saguntum , a Rome-allied city in Spain , and the perilous crossing of the Alps . In what is perhaps the book 's best episode , Malchus is sent back to Carthage by Hannibal to plead for reinforcements so that Rome may be conquered , and falls into a web of suspicion and betrayal , seriously compromising his faith in his homeland . Eventually Malchus will also visit Rome , allowing the novel to contrast the dynamic and vital Rome of republican years with the leisure loving , flabby and deluded Carthage . Henty weaves his history with his fiction in a relatively odd manner , usually relating the details of an event up front in a solid chunk of historical reporting , then back-tracking to detail Malchus ' involvement within the event . This may prove too distracting to readers looking for a well-rounded novelistic treatment of the times ( as might be found in Robert Graves , for instance ) , but it succeeds perfectly in achieving what Henty set out to achieve : namely , interesting young readers in history by making it seem real and exciting .
AB	I ca n't say enough good things about this book . I had tried everything . I was fairly successful on the Body for Life program , but it took too much time . All I did on that program was eat and workout . I have a life . I need time for my family , work , continuing education and other activities . When I saw my life suffering at the expense of my body , I had to compromise the Body for Life program . I then ballooned back up to being obese . My doctor tried to talk me into a gastric bypass because my weight was getting so bad . This book from the Mayo Clinic gave me a diet that was very easy and had a lot of great food . I have n't even been tempted to wander from this program at all . The variety of food has filled my food addiction while also taking the weight off of me . I have been continually losing weight and my doctor is not worried about me at all now . She even just filled out a physical report stating that I am in very good health . If you want good food , good health and time for a real life , this is the only book for you .
BC	The other thing is that often these cell phone companies -- not often , but once in a while -- they 'll send you something either in your bill or separately that indicates that they 've changed a fee , or change aid service , or some little thing in your contract has changed and have you an opt out clause . Can you use that to get out of your contract . Now , there 's a little time window there . The other thing , can you transfer something . Miles , if I think I do n't like my contract or I want something else , and you are prepared to take my contract because you just want a contract for a few months , I can transfer that contract to you . We both agree on it , and my cell phone company will charge me a little fee to transfer it . If you want to transfer and you ca n't find somebody to transfer to , choose two web sites to look at . One of them is CellTradeUSA.com . The other one is , resellular.com . That 's resellular with an S. For a fee they will match you up with someone who is prepared to take your contract . You 'll also probably have to pay a fee to the cell phone company that someone else can take your contract if you need out of it -- Miles . So they 're assumable ? That 's pretty good . VELSH They are assumable , that 's right . You will pay some fee for it , but it might be less than that fee you pay to cancel your contract . You know , it 's worth putting out , though , that those fees to back out , you are just paying for the phone you did n't pay for in the first place ? So , keep that in mind . That 's exactly right . If you do n't like contracts , buy a phone separately . All right . One more tip you can do here is on home phone service ? If you want to dump the phone company , you did it , I have done it . Dump is such an ugly word . Have you done it , Ali ? I have done -- I mean , I use my cell phone all the time . Oh , you do n't even have any sort of land line service ? I have one of those VOIP land lines that you were talking about . Vonage , or the like . Yeah , Internet . All right , Ali . Thank you . All right .

BC	None . ( UNINTELLIGIBLE) , right ? So , anything you get you have to earn yourself . Right . And you 're sick and you 're in bed and you 're depressed and you have physical illness and emotional illness . Right . And at the same time , tabloids are having a field day with you . Right . How did you react ? It was -- it 's been , it 's been hell . I mean , it 's been really , really hard between the hospitals and the ulcers and the nervous breakdowns . Did you ever think maybe it is n't worth it ? I know it 's a lot of money , but maybe I should just leave it alone and say goodbye ? I 'm going to fight until the end . My husband is worth it . I 'll fight until the end . He wanted you to have this ? He wanted me to have it and I 'll fight until the end . Did the trust specify an amount , or did it just keep growing as ... Well , that 's the thing , we have n't received the trust . The trust was never produced in court . All right . How did they come up with 88.5 million , why not 86 , why not 92 ? Well , that 's Judge Carter 's determination , essentially . How much was he worth ? He was worth a lot . He was worth a lot . There 's been bitter disputes as to his exact worth . But he was -- there 's no question that he was a very , very wealthy man . So , Pierce , the son who fought you . The other son did not fight it as much , right ? Well , the other son actually filed a lawsuit against Pierce , and that 's something that has worked its way and is working its way through the Texas court system . But no one is poor out of this ? These two sons are going to do all right ? Well , as of now ... Anna Nicole is poor today . As of now Pierce has everything and Anna Nicole has not collected a penny from even this judgment . Not even a widow 's allowance , spousal support , nothing . No, even we 'll give you something-something a month ? No. Not since Howard ... Wait a minute , now no one 's denying that the marriage took place , right ? Right . Or that you did n't live together . Right . you know , again these are issues . that is why we are in court . you are saying that you will never give up . SMIT right Do you carry a locket of his ? Yes . What is -- do you have it ? Yes . You want to see ? Yes . What do you keep in it ? This is the day we got married and he -- we threw doves . And he laughs , and I just remember the day ( UNINTELLIGIBLE) . Me throwing a dove away and him laughing . I see that , yes . Really cute . You 're releasing a dove . And he 's laughing . And he 's getting a good laugh . Where were you married ? We were married at a chapel . In ? The Doves Chapel ( ph ) in Houston . In Houston . Where did you honeymoon ? We honeymooned in Bali . Are you engaged ? No. This is just an old ring . It - Was he very , very generous with you ?
BC	And , of course , you know , the -- the -- the domination of the hip-hop industry culturally has accentuated that phenomenon . You know , before the civil rights revolution , there was a term that we used in the black community : You have to be a credit to your race . And being a credit to your race was not being a ghetto fabulous thug. Being a credit to your race was being academically more competitive , being a decent human being , and being mainstream America . Do you buy into , Danyel , what Niger is saying , that this is self-imposed ? Or is this something beyond the black culture , that ... I think ... ... that this victimization is feeding off of something else ? I think it has been going on for so , so long . I think it goes all the way back to slave times . If you were the type of slave that wanted to work in the big house , you were the house N-word , there was always this association , like , if you 're white , you 're better . I really do n't put a value system on it . I do n't think it 's ... Are you embarrassed by this , to see these kids talking about ... I 'm not embarrassed by it . . . failing classes because they do n't want to be accused of being too white ? I mean , I agree . I think it 's tragic . I think it 's terrible . And I just wonder , though , where are these kids ' parents ? These are good , smart students in good schools . Where are their parents ? My mother was there to tell me . My father was there to tell me . I 'm wondering , where are people to tell them , this is not necessary ? There 's no such thing as acting white . There 's being a good student . There 's being a good person . There 's no such thing as acting white . And being black does n't mean you are lazy or you have to be thugged out or anything like that . I do take issue a little bit that hip-hop has exacerbated it . But I just feel like you can be a kid ... You have got to -- you have got to agree that the worst elements in hip-hop have . I mean , there are more ... Possibly . But I do believe that , just because you wear baggy pants and you have your hair cut a certain way does not mean that you are a thug and does not mean that you ca n't excel in high school or college . What kind of white trap is this for black kids ? What kind of white trap ? Yes . I mean , you know , the -- the ... Let me tell you , Paula... It 's the man . It 's the man that is responsible . He has to defend his whole race . ... me as the representative ... There are two of us here . ... as the representative of the white ... No, there are two of us . ... of the white race at the table , yes . Last time I looked , I thought I was white , too . Well , no , there you ... What I was going to say , if I can answer a different question , was , what is interesting to me is this does n't just happen in the black community . I mean , I have seen it happen in the gay community in terms of some people concerned that some gay people want to get too married . Are they trying to be straight ? Like they 're trying to buy in to the straight culture ?
BC	We ask at the post office . OK . We 're looking for Elsie Jessop . You do n't know anything about her ? We do n't . ... familiar name to me . OK . We ask at the grocery store . We 're trying to find Elsie Jessop . Do you know Elsie Jessop ? The store manager does n't want us there . ( INAUDIBLE ) do n't need to talk . I will call the officers and have you removed . We 're " Keeping Them Honest , " so we get in our car and explore other parts of Jeffs ' kingdom . We go to the house where Johnny Jessop was raised by his mom . A new family now lives there , but is not at home . A neighbor across the street surprises us by talking , saying she does know Elsie and her son , Johnny . He 's one of the " Lost Boys " who 's filed suit to try to find out where she is . You 've no idea . You have n't seen her ? No. Not that I can recollect . One woman is even more talkative . Do you know Elsie Jessop ? I knew her from her son . We 're looking for her , because her son is looking for her . Yes , I know her son . I do n't know where she is right now . Johnny , who wants nothing to do with the church or polygamy , is not surprised we found nothing . He 's gone back looking himself . It 's been pretty hard . I do n't really know how I got through it , but I did . Johnny may very well win his lawsuit . But even if a judge orders Warren Jeffs to talk , there 's no way to physically force Jeffs to do so if he does n't want to . And Johnny , who now has a job and hopes to get a GED someday , knows that . If you do get to see your mom , and I sure hope you do ... JESSO Sure . ... what 's the first thing you want to do ? Give her a big hug and tell her how much I love her . What has Johnny been doing all these years since being kicked out ? The answer is quite startling and depressing . Actually , for some of the years , Johnny just lived with other kids , other " Lost Boys " , no adult supervision . And he was basically squatting in houses . Some of the time he spent with older siblings but never his mother . There were actually , Anderson , two court case in which a judge said that Johnny had to go back to his mother . His mother was at the court . But when he came back here to Hilldale , Utah , they said they did n't want him , and Johnny left again . The last two years have been better for him . A foundation in Salt Lake City 300 miles north of here takes in Lost Boys , gives them free room and board , and that 's where Johnny 's been living the last couple of years . What are Warren Jeffs ' lawyers saying about this lawsuit ? Well , it 's not clear how they feel . It 's also not clear who will be representing him in this case . His criminal lawyers may not represent him in this civil suit . We called the criminal lawyers , and there was no comment coming from them about this case .
BC	I absolutely buy that . this is also interrelated -- it just defies description that you would n't be discussing -- you got to be , you know -- if you are not going to believe in the United Nations , which we do n't on a lot of levels , then you have to -- you kind of -- then you know what ? You got to do it on your own . And you have to go and deal with it . And I think something that truly upset me about what happened here , and the lack of our response was that they are firing American missiles at Beirut and there are Americans there . And at no point does our president kind of go , hey , guys , come here , come here , you ca n't be shooting that stuff at them . To some degree , wait a minute , does n't America wind up a little bit damned if they do , damned if they do n't ? We 're told , you have to be involved , you have to help this region . Many Americans felt like when we went into Iraq , they did n't understand everything is a notion of OK , we 're doing something over there . And that has n't worked out . How do we move forward ? What can we agree at ? But let 's remember ... There is something -- there is something -- first of all , there is something very clear here that we need to confront . Remember , part of the rational for going to war in Iraq was that somehow this would make Israel safer , you know , that it would somehow democratize the Middle East . It would be easier for Israel to defend itself . Well , it 's been the exact opposite . We need to look at the unintended consequences . The unintended consequence of what Israel did was that Hezbollah is now strengthened . Hezbollah has emerged with more support from the people and more strength around the world . So what was the point of that ? How do we move forward here then , though ? Very succinctly here , Wade , how do we move forward in this area where , you know , every president , Democrat , Republican , conservative , liberal has looked at this and they 've tried things and it has n't worked ? You know , it 's an intractable problem . I mean , I 've been with the ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) on the West Bank and moved in the desert from Jordan with them . I 've gone over the Israeli border and actually been on the rubble of their homes that were destroyed in the memory of their grandparents . Remember , this started in 1948 . Can they be brought beyond all those years ? We all know the history , it 's very complex . Can we move forward in 2007 on this ? How , Reza ? Yes . You know , in the '90s we used to say that the road to peace in the Middle East goes through Jerusalem . Nothing has changed . That 's still the fact . And that 's precisely because -- we talk about the Arab world as though there is something that the Arab world has in common with each other . They do n't . They do n't share the same culture . They barely share the same language . They barely share the same religion .
BC	OK , let 's go on to the next picture . I believe this is a policeman in London making what you could call a very vigorous arrest . Can you tell us about this ? Yes . Indeed , this was a Scoopt member who was sitting at home , heard a hell of a kafuffle outside his house , looked out the window and saw the police chasing down a driver , forcing him to crash against a wall , smashed the car windows , dragged the driver out , stunned him with a taser gun and then pointed automatic rifles at him . So out guy on the scene brought out his camera and photographed the whole event . He was n't -- at the time , he was n't thinking I 'm going to make a lot of money out of this . He was acting as a witness . He just saw something that was of interest . And also , he -- this was shortly after the poor Brazilian chap was shot dead by the police in London . And he , in his mind , was thinking , are the police going to overreact here , are they going to do it again ? If they are , I 'm going to hold them to account . I 'm going to be a witness . Now , nothing went wrong . It was a perfectly valid arrest . Afterwards , it was an hour later , he thought , hang on , maybe these pictures actually do have some value . Sent them to us , we sold them to the " London Evening Standard . " OK . Let 's go on to the next picture . And this is a slightly different kind of thing , because this was n't a fundamentally important or newsworthy event , lives were not at stake . This was a footballer smoking a cigarette . I think everyone will recognize who we 're talking about here . What was the value of this picture ? The financial value ? Yes , the financial value and the news value of Zinedine Zidane having a cigarette . OK . Well , the financial value was in the thousands of dollars . Again , commercial sensitive , I ca n't tell you the exact figure , but it was in the thousands , and that picture sold very widely . Five U.K. papers used it and it sold internationally as well . The news story , frankly , is relatively spurious . When we first saw the picture , we thought this is just a paparazzi shot . You know , a footballer having a cigarette , fairly interesting . What made the story for us was that Zinedine Zidane had actually spearheaded an anti-smoking campaign in 2002 , the previous World Cup . So that gave us the news story . Now , I 'm not saying it 's a front page breaking news story at all , but . No, but you did touch on something that is interesting and important here . Is this going to turn all of us into paparazzi ? Is this going to turn anybody with a cell phone into some member of a lurking horde of people chasing celebrities on the off chance they might be able to get a shot , just the way professional paparazzi have been doing for years ? Well , I was first asked that question in July 2005 , and 18 months on , we simply have n't seen it . We do get and we handle celebrity content , but we simply have n't had a kind of invasive camera-phone-in-your- face-at-every-opportunity content . That has n't come through . Maybe it will as this phenomenon expands . And part of our role as the gatekeeper here is to filter it and to editorialize it and to help educate people , you know , what 's ethically OK , what 's legally OK , you know , public place/private property , what the differences are . And this is one of the reasons why we do n't just publish content on our Web site or anywhere else . We filter it , editorialize it , and then if we 're happy dealing with it we push it out to the mainstream media .
BC	Well , no , this is absolutely right , Jonathan . When I was doing my reporting on Dubai , and I tried to look at some of the underbelly of Dubai , you know , beyond the glitz and the glamour of the hotels and the developments , and when I visited some of these labor camps , I did see far too many laborers who were treated as , according to Human Rights Watch , less than human . I saw far too many laborers who were not paid on time . And , you know , in some ways they are exploited both in Dubai , with the construction companies who are not paying them on time , but they 're also exploited back home , tragically , by unscrupulous agents who force them to pay this exorbitant fee for their visa . And , you know , any city that has the ability to build islands in the sea , to make ten times their coastline , you know , through building these islands , can certainly get these construction companies in order to treat these workers in a more humane manner . And I believe that Dubai will never become a great city until it becomes a good city , and they 're going to have to get these sort of things in order in order for them to be a great global city . Afshin Molavi , of the New America Foundation , and once again , his article in this month 's edition of the " National Geographic . " Thanks so much for talking with us . Thank you , Jonathan , it 's a pleasure . We take another break . When we come back , the other emirate . Dubai and its big brother in the desert . Stay with us . Dubai sits on the eastern edge of the vast Arabian Desert , along with six other tiny sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates . The UAE was founded in 1971 after gaining its independence from Britain . For decades , it was ruled by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi , who spread his realm 's oil wealth across the emirates . He died two years ago and was smoothly succeeded by his son . Welcome back . A moment ago we were talking about Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai . Well , Sheikh Zayed is credited with transforming the entire UAE from just a spot on the map to a world financial hub . Abu Dhabi is the country 's capital and the biggest , richest and most powerful of the emirates . In recent years , many investors , tourists and the headlines have gone to Dubai , leaving the more established city-state searching for a new plan of its own . Kristi Lu Stout has this look . Thanks to its vast oil reserves , Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest of the seven city-states in the United Arab Emirates . But for many years it has existed in the shadow of Dubai . Its more worldly neighbor has stolen the march in many areas , like construction and finance , media and technology . But Abu Dhabi is ready for its close up . Massive building works are underway , its physical and cultural landscape changing at a dazzling rate . The city is just evolving , but it 's evolving in a controlled manner . The quality has been demanded of the design of our buildings , the planning that is going into the city-wide planning works . Each of our projects is planned properly . The infrastructure is being developed ahead of the built form .
BC	Many trucking companies and port operators were overwhelmed with the program , leaving the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to say , " We do n't know the details of this program . The 469 pages of regulations were just published and we are in the process of reviewing them . " And then there is the question of the cards themselves . They 're designed to contain biometric identifying data , but there will be no readers at the ports to read the data . The Coast Guard says it will deal with that issue by conducting random checks at ports with mobile card readers . And then there 's the question of cost . Each card is expected to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 140 to $ 160 , a cost that right now is expected to be paid by the workers , Lou , and not by the companies . The charade that we call homeland security continues . This , however , is an important step , it seems to me . And one that should have been taken , one would think , long ago . Yes . It is a big step , and a lot of people acknowledge that there are problems , and hopefully they will be worked out as they begin rolling out implementation . Something less than the five years it 's taken to this point . Bill Tucker , thank you very much . Coming up next , foreign spies stepping up their efforts to steal U.S. secret defense technology . We 'll have a report on which nations are behind the espionage . A congressman at the forefront of the battle against illegal immigration taking his top stand into the new democratically- controlled Congress . Congressman Brian Bilbray joins us here . And the lab that tests and certifies those e-voting machines , well , it has a few problems of its own . We 'll have a report now on the latest threat to e-voting . Stay with us . Foreign spies tonight are increasing their efforts to steal American technological secrets . A Defense Security Service report saying there is a surge in espionage activity from Asian countries , and some reports saying communist China is leading the way . Kathleen Koch reports . Espionage attempts aimed at sensitive U.S. defense technology have shot up 43 percent over the last year . That finding in a new report by the Defense Security Service counterintelligence office . Space systems , lasers and missile and radar-evading stealth technology were in greatest demand . I 'm quite concerned that the technology that this country relies upon for its national security is being steadily eroded and compromised by enemies , actual or potential . And East Asian and Pacific countries are the biggest suspected thieves . The study found they account for a third of all spy attempts . The Near East is next at 23 percent , followed by Eurasia at 19 percent . And South Asia at 13 percent . Africa and the Western Hemisphere count for 11 percent . The 29-page report does n't accuse specific countries . But China , followed by Russia and Iran , are often cited by U.S. officials as the top spy threats to the United States . It allows them to get up the proverbial learning curve far faster to avoid costly and time-consuming mistakes and to focus their energies on improving on our designs rather than having to come up with them in the first place themselves .
BC	They did n't even get into thinking in that direction . All they could think about was that this is their grandson that they love , this is their nephew that they love . And to have these kinds of details reported in the media in front of the nation , as opposed to given to the family in private , is -- it 's unbelievably painful . By the way , we mentioned it earlier . What are they waiting for from the state ? What kind of remains are they waiting for , the family ? The tests are still being done on the remains , and when everything is completed , they will be released to the family , for both Laci and Conner . But they , at this point , do n't know when that will be . Chris Pixley , as a defense attorney , what was your reaction to what was learned today ? Well , I think , Larry , at this point in time , the prosecution may not only have to prove that Scott Peterson is a murderer , they may have to prove that he 's a sociopath . I know that Dr. Wecht is one of the foremost experts in this area , but the idea that a knotted bit of tape wrapped around the neck is something that was picked up in the wash , the idea that this slice through the right shoulder and into the right lung is something that just happened while the body was floating around in the water , I think , from a defense standpoint and for a juror , is difficult to believe . Dr. Wecht , can we draw anything from the implication that the baby 's remains were apparently more intact than the mother 's ? Yes , Larry . I was going to comment on that , if I could , and also on this business of strangulation , and also on the report itself , if I may . Sure . Go ahead . Oh . We 're on the air now ? KIN Yes , we 're on . Oh , I 'm sorry . First of all , I would ... I 'm work quick . ... say with regard to the report , the report that I have looks to me to be complete . So I do n't know what they 're talking about insofar as the release of more of the report . With regard to the strangulation ... Wait a minute . You have the report ? Yes . I have a copy of the one-sheet report that was sent to ... Oh , the one sheet report . OK . Go ahead . With regard to strangulation , once the baby is detached from the mother 's placenta , you do n't have to strangle . The baby is dead . The baby 's going to die -- the fetus is going to die in a matter of a couple minutes . And with regard to the condition of the baby , this to me remains a major point . I said seven weeks ago , and I remain with that thought , that this baby , small body mass , could not have been floating free in that water for these three-and-a-half months and have remained intact to the point that it was . The sex was immediately determined , I think even by a non-physician when the baby was discovered on a Sunday night . If that baby had been lying out for all that time , the external genitalia would have sloughed off , would have been decomposed .
BC	Do you think it can work ? I think people are skeptical but it 's better than the alternative which is doing nothing and watching the ship go down . We can only hope . This idea of getting involved in Somalia again I 'm sure just has a lot of people on edge . Barbara Starr in Nairobi , Nir Rosen ( ph ) in New York , Ken Menkhaus in Washington . Thanks very much . From Somalia back to Iraq . Coming up how military discards became Iraq 's most lethal weapons . But first , some of the fallen THIS WEEK AT WAR . The United States started the new year by reaching a sobering milestone , 3000 killed since the beginning of the war in Iraq . Army Sergeant John Michael Sullivan of Hickston , Tennessee is one who fell while serving his country . He thought it was a good thing , what they were doing over and he just wanted to be with his friends . Sullivan 's wife Michelle gave birth to their first son , John Michael Jr. just hours before her husband 's death . He was scheduled to come home next week . Sullivan was a member of the 2nd Battalion 2nd Infantry Division out of Ft . Carson , Colorado . His Humvee was struck by a roadside bomb in Baghdad . He was just 22 years old . Deaths from those roadside bombs , IEDs , are blamed for almost half of all combat deaths of U.S. military in Iraq . We 're introducing a new THIS WEEK AT WAR department called " Weapons of War " and back now with us CNN military analyst Brigadier General James " Spider " Marks , U.S. military retired . Spider , these IEDs are described as pure evil by the U.S. forces who encounter them every day and they come in different forms . They sure do , John . By definition , first of all what this is is an IED is a booby trap . It 's a weapon of choice . It 's not an alternative . A lot of it is made out of military discards , old armaments from the Saddam Hussein years ? Sure is . Here is a graphic that will portray that . Anti-tank weapon would n't be detonated by pressure , it would be command detonated . You have got an artillery shell wrapped in concrete , so you can hide it on the side of the road , looks like a cinder block or a 500-pound bomb we 've got here that 's buried . Again , all of those could be detonated in another of different ways , either hard wired or use of a cell phone or a garage door opener . The troops that I was riding with were worried about these bombs but the ones they really fear is called EFP , explosive form projectiles or penetrators , shaped chargers is what they call it . What are those all about ? Those are directional , they are shaped . Let me , very briefly on this graphic , this is where the projectile would occur . It 's an explosive . It has a conical shaped thing around it . It 's metal . When the explosive goes off , it collapses , and you now have formed , in essence a bullet and it 's going to move in the direction that you -- the way you shape it and aim that thing as you can see in these graphics right here .
BC	All right , Jacki . Thank you very much . Any time . Soledad . Always good to get the search out of the search and rescue , and go right to the rescue is what I say . I like that . Ahead on AMERICAN MORNING Ali Velshi is in Detroit for the North American International Auto Show . While Ford looks to the future , got an update on some of the workers the company is leaving behind . And then , a look at the words of Martin Luther King , Jr. Back where it all began in Montgomery , Alabama . Our special series begins this morning on AMERICAN MORNING. We 're back in a moment . Welcome back everybody . Developing news this morning , new pictures from Iraq . At least four people dead after a gunmen ambush a bus in Baghdad . It happened overnight . And President Bush is declaring a disaster area for 57 counties in Nebraska after recent ice and snowstorms . Coming up on 25 minutes past the hour . Time for " Minding Your Business " and a quick check on Wall Street ; the Dow opens the week at 12,398 ; down more than 82 points on Friday . The Nasdaq starts off at 2,434 , off 19 points , and the S&P 500 down more than 8 points to open at 1,409 . Gear heads rejoice . It is auto show time in Detroit . Over the next two weeks carmakers will unveil more than 45 new models . It will be all those cool concept cars . If you are into cars , you 'll be drooling a little bit . Reporters are getting a sneak peek as we speak . Among them are intrepid business maven Ali Velshi . ALI VELSHI , CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT , AMERICAN MORNING ( on camera ) : There is a lot of excitement at this year 's auto show . And there is a lot of concern about the future of the auto industry . This is the Ford Edge . It was introduced last year by Ford as part of its " Way Forward" , the restructuring of the company . Cars like the Edge might be part of Ford 's future , but it did n't come soon enough for a lot of Ford workers . It was almost a year ago , to the day , that Ford announced its layoffs . Some 30,000 workers at nine plants across North America . After the early morning announcement at Ford headquarters , I drove to nearby Wixom , Michigan , site of one of the doomed factories . In the parking lot there , I met Darrell Hoffman , a 28-year Ford veteran . You got a lot of family here . You know , a lot of friends . Because of his seniority Darrell was able to keep his job at Ford . Instead , like about 75,000 other Ford and General Motors employees , he took a buyout package , one that gave him health benefits and a pension for life . Ford offered him some money for job retraining . Darrell got his commercial truck driver 's license . So this is your past , this is your history . Yeah . This could be your future ? Yeah , absolutely . Over nearly three decades Darrell watched Ford , GM and Chrysler lose market share to Japanese carmakers , who could build cheaper cars than the Big Three could . He even did his part to save Ford money by cutting large rags into smaller pieces for his paint shop .
BC	Welcome back . Breaking news out of Iraq this morning . U.S. troops and attack helicopters involved in a major gunfight against insurgents in Baghdad . It 's happening right now . Wildfires rage across Malibu 's pricey beach front , and the home of actress Suzanne Sommers is one of four destroyed . A year and a half now since Hurricane Katrina , and finally , finally , the check may be in the mail for some homeowners in Mississippi , who suffered big losses . It 's 25 minutes past the hour . Ali Velshi is here with that . Hello , Ali . How are you , guys ? There is this report swirling now , and we ca n't get confirmation from either party , which is interesting , it suggests there might be something to this . That State Farm , the largest property insurer in Mississippi , is in negotiations with the attorney general of that state to come to some sort of a mass settlement for those Mississippi claimants who said they did n't get proper payouts , or any payouts , because the insurer , State Farm -- and others , by the way -- claim their house was damaged by water , by a storm surge , as opposed hurricane winds . And that distinction has caused a lot of people not to get the money they thought they were entitled to . Now there 's been no mass claim . There has been no mass settlement , even though we sort of hear references sometimes to class - action suits . There are no class-action suits . There are a few lawyers that represent hundreds of claimants , but the insurance companies , like in many of these types of things , have chosen to fight each one of these cases individually , saying that they are individual policies , they 're individual contracts . There is no class action . That , of course , makes it difficult for claimants because when it 's a class action , someone else puts up the money , someone else fights that case , and you get your settlement , albeit a smaller one . In this case there have had to be hundreds and hundreds of individual claims against State Farm , or others . If this is true -- and neither State Farm nor the attorney general of Mississippi will tell us about this -- this could be massive . It would be the first of its kind . It does not right now involve anybody claiming against the other insurers , nor does it involve anybody claiming against State Farm in Louisiana or Alabama , this is just Mississippi . As I understand it , the stuff that has leaked out , indicates that State Farm will make no admissions . It will just be a check , and so , in other words , there wo n't be any sort of official precedent in writing . Correct . I think there are probably some people who would like an admission , but I think most people need to get on with their lives . And they would like to be able to rebuild their homes , and that would be a big step forward . And I think everybody in this country who has insurance will now realize that -- make sure you read it , the company is clear , you 're clear , put everything in writing that if a storm comes , am I covered ? If a flood -- if a hurricane comes and causes a flood , am I covered ?
BC	Is there something about putting your life out there in this way that puts intense pressure on your relationship ? You know , I think the one thing that Amber and I make sure we do every day is take some time for us . So - and , you know , focus on our relationship , and put that first . I mean , we`re in the reality TV show business , if you will . And that` s our job . But at the same time , our life together is the most important thing to us . And we always make that a priority . You`ve got your priorities straight . So you say , You , cameras , get out of here . You know . Yes , you know what ? Quality time . Going into this show , we did have a really good relationship with the producers on both sides that they knew our limits and we knew their limits . So we had a really good relationship going into it . I think some of these other stars - it - I - I mean , it does add a lot of pressure , having the cameras there and having people judge you , you know ? It is tough . But maybe - I do n` t know , the arrangements going into it just were n` t as good as ours were . Well , let` s talk about the new reality show . Because we all know you two like to live on the edge . And here you are with Rob and Amber again , stall lives ( ph ) . Well , you`re taking money you guys have won in the past from reality shows , and you`re gambling with it in Vegas , trying to be a professional poker play . It` s not gambling . Amber , you agree with me here . I agree . You have to be nervous about this . Well , that was one of our biggest arguments , was the fact that I kept saying , Honey , I ca n` t believe you want to go and be a professional gambler . And he` s like , it` s not gambling . I said , it is gambling . It` s a calculated risk . It` s a calculated risk . He has so far as to quote a dictionary of the definition of "gambling , " right ? It was - it was crazy . I still call it gambling . And a lot of people are going to say , You`re crazy , because the odds are against you playing poker like this . Are you a little bit crazy ? Well , you know , we did n` t get to where we are today without taking some risks . And I think that` s my personality . Luckily , I have a wife that loves me and stands behind me and was willing to take the chance with me . Take a big chance , because you`re the one who actually won a million bucks on " Survivor " ( INAUDIBLE) . I did . I did . And - and we have been very smart with the money , so far . And to tell you the truth , I would n` t have supported him if I did n` t know that he did - I knew he had some talent behind me . And he` s not going to come to me with anything that he does n` t feel strongly about as well . I mean , he` s my husband ; I want to support him no matter what .
BC	Seventeen-year-old Busi Dladlu is a single mother of one , and like any young mother , struggles with the new challenges of caring for her 7-month-old son . It 's always mealtime here in her small shack . It 's when little mouths are hungry that Busi feels the weight of the crisis that surrounds her . She is the surrogate mother of five orphan siblings . Their mother died of AIDS more than a year ago , leaving a heavily pregnant Busi in charge of a household of hungry mouths ranging in age from 1 to 15 . She 's a child raising children . I used to cry every day . The hardest thing when I wake up in the morning , the children come to me , " Hey , sis , we are hungry . " No money for food , clothes or even medicine . Two of the children are HIV positive , 7-year-old Lalisiwe ( ph ) and 3-year-old Tulani ( ph ) . But as difficult as things may look , there does seem to be a ray of hope , in the form of Hope Worldwide , a U.S.-based NGO. Hope Worldwide provides monthly food rations to child-headed households in Soweto as well as counseling and supervision . We 're really overwhelmed by the issue of childhood households and abuse of orphans . Right now in South Africa there are about 5 to 5.5 million people that are -- that are living with HIV. We have over a million orphans due to HIV. By 2010 , we may have 2.5 to 3 million orphans . Probably one-fifth of those will be child-headed households . Ottenweller says at the end of the day , organizations like Hope Worldwide can only do so much and that the various communities ravaged by AIDS have to chip in to help save the children . Before that happens Busi and many like her seem destined for a life of misery and misfortune . As AIDS continues to wreak havoc here , reducing once thriving families into broken down households headed by children . Child-headed households , as HIV has devastated this country , literally decimated generations , what 's going to happen ? What can be done to help these kids ? And there 's more coming up . OPRAH WINFREY , TALK SHOW HOST/PHILANTHROPIS I would like to say to the world , the reason why the children remain devastated and are taking care of their own siblings and are heading households is because the world has not responded in kind . The reason why that is -- that continues to happen is because people let it happen . There are enough people in this world with enough resources to make a difference so there are not child-headed households . And so perhaps maybe there will be an awakening . You know , everybody has all these conferences and they talk about it and they talk about and what could be done . What needs to happen is people like myself who have the finances and who have the access and who have the resources , corporations , need to step in . Step in and make some changes so that there are shelters and homes headed by adults who can take care of these children . That 's what needs to happen .
BC	And as I mentioned , Ashley 's story and her parents ' decision have created a firestorm of e-mails , blog entries , and editorials . Medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen has been tracking the emotional Internet traffic -- Elizabeth . Thanks , Sanjay . It seems like everyone on the Internet these days has an opinion about what Ashley 's parents did to their daughter . Now , a lot of the blogging has been done from other parents with disabled children . For example , a blogger who calls herself "nuf said " ' wrote , " Ashley 's parents need to be charged with child abuse . Her physicians need to be locked up for life for mutilation . I am just revolted . " Now there have also been positive comments . For example , Christina writes on the CNN.com Web site , " We want our children to be happy . And in the face of such a heartbreaking disability , why would n't we do everything in our power to obtain that happiness ? " Now this story lives on the Internet . It 's the only place where Ashley 's parents communicate with the public . And I 'm sure that we 're going to see even more opinions come out in the days and weeks to come . Sanjay ? I bet you 're right . That sounds like it would be true . Thanks , Elizabeth . Whether in you 're 40s and worried about your parents , or you 're in your 60s and beyond worried about senior moments , a new study offers some hope . Researchers at Columbia University found folate , or folic acid , may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer 's Disease . Very interesting . Scientists discovered that all the people they researched , those who had very little folate in their diet had the highest risk of Alzheimer 's , while those who consumed adequate amounts through diet or supplements had the lowest risk . Now you may be asking yourself , what is an adequate amount ? Well , a cup of frozen spinach would work or two cups of peas or a three ounce piece of liver . Each of those would satisfy your folate needs for the day and these researchers believe lower your risk of developing the memory-robbing disease . Over the next few decades , the number of Alzheimer 's cases is going to explode . It 's a fact . Experts predict a quadrupling , four times in the number of people with the disease . What many people do n't realize is there 's no definitive diagnosis for Alzheimer 's . Judy Fortin has that story . I was relieved , really , because there was a name to it . It was n't a good thing , but at least I knew that I was n't crazy . Fifty-year-old Kris Bakowski has early onset Alzheimer 's . Getting the diagnosis took almost nine months . Unfortunately , even for the typical form of Alzheimer 's disease that happens in older adults , half of the people in the United States who have Alzheimer 's disease go unrecognized by their physicians . Dr. Morris says specialists are 90 percent accurate in diagnosing the disease , but first must eliminate other illnesses and then ask a series of questions to determine extent of memory loss . It surprises many people that Alzheimer 's disease has no test . You ca n't do a blood test or a CAT scan or an MRI scan .
BC	And Judaism and Christianity have gone through several reformations in their history , in which they have distanced themselves for various reasons , at times , from the political order . Islam is still struggling with that , the relationship to the state . How do you stop a guy like this guy who -- who believes that shooting abortion doctors , I mean , is the right thing to do or a Muslim terrorist ? Can you stop them and turn them ? No, you ca n`t . I mean , you stop them the way you stop any criminal . You do whatever preventive measures , take whatever preventative measures you can take . But this is too far gone when you have someone who is a member of an organization like Army of God , who believes God is the general and we`re in a cosmic war . There` s no stopping that . OK , Scott , thank you very much . Now , listen , if you are standing up against anybody who is hijacking your religion , I want to hear about it . This is the place where you can hold them accountable . Draw me a line at GlennBeck@CNN.com . All right . Welcome to " The Real story . " Now , by now , you`ve probably heard the news that President Bush personally ordered the raid on an Iranian government office inside Iraq last week . But what you may not have heard is that the military now believes that the five men they detained are connected to a special Iranian Revolutionary Guard unit . If this is true , this is a very big deal , because that unit has been known to provide funds and weapons , including IEDs , to insurgents -- i .e . , terrorists -- that are attacking coalition troops . Get it ? But even though this latest raid got the most publicity , it was far from the first time that Iranians were found inside Iraq . On both December 20th and the 21st , U.S. forces found Iranians in the country with links to -- as a U.S. general delicately put it -- with links to illegal activities that have occurred there . Hmm . The real story tonight ? Iran is committing acts of war against us , and no one in our government wants to acknowledge it . People are afraid that they`re going to be accused of either trying to provoke Iran or they`re just trying to set up some sort of smokescreen to distract everybody from a war in Iraq . Well , distraction or not , people in America need to hear it . They need to hear it now , and they need to hear it from our president . Honestly , President Bush is like a Navajo wind talker at times when he gives these speeches . It like he` s developed some sort of code that he just hopes that people will be able to decipher on what he` s really trying to say . Now , the reason why he makes such big news when he says something about Iran is because people believe , " Oh , my gosh , look what he` s saying now . this is the first time I`ve ever heard him say that . " Reality is he` s been talking about Iran for years . He just -- in typical George W. Bush , God bless him , typical George W. Bush style , he never expresses it clearly .
BC	We take another break . When we come back , what happens to the ones who are not found ? Stay with us . Time is crucial in a kidnapping . Few children are killed by their captors , but in the United States three-quarters of those who do die are murdered within the first three hours . After that , delay has a different impact . The longer a child a missing , the harder they are to find because they grow and change . Welcome back . How do you tell people and police to be on the lookout for someone if you do n't know what they look like ? Babies grow into children , children into young adults . Experts do , though , have some tools to make something more than just an educated guess . Tom Foreman explains . When Katelyn Rivera - Helton disappeared in Pennsylvania in 1999 , she was one year old and looked like this . Now , eight years later , forensic artists think she might look like this . At the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children , they have many so-called age-progressed photos . And Larry Bonney hopes you will take a hard look whenever you see one . The trick is that , if you live next door to this child , or you have this child in your grade school class , and you 're a schoolteacher , and then you see the age-progressed photograph , that may ring a bell , and say , boy , that looks an awful lot like Jimmy . Be thorough . Just take your time . Drawing a child who has been missing for years depends on precise knowledge of human growth and genetics . Look at Shawn Hornbeck from when he disappeared at the age of 11 , four years ago . To age his image , artists first considered typical adolescent growth patterns . They made his face longer , his hair and eyebrows darker . The eyes , themselves , somewhat more narrow . His nose was lengthened and his cheekbones were made more prominent . His mouth was drawn a little wider . His chin made more distinct . After all of this , artists typically look at pictures of the missing child 's relatives . If the child is taken at two and they 're now ten , they 'll get pictures from the family at age 10 . So of mom and dad ? Mom , dad , yeah , of , you know , blood relatives , immediate family is what they 're looking for , assuming that genetic traits will remain fairly constant as the child grows . It 's all blended , and this is how forensic artists thought Shawn would look at 15 . And here he is . In the end , all of this is a little bit about science , a little bit about art , and a lot about math , about simply improving the odds that a missing child will be spotted . We want to keep these kids out there in front of the public . The children need to have people looking for them . And that 's a need that does not change , even as years pass . Tom Foreman , CNN, Washington . Many parents of abducted children are haunted by the unknowns . Not only of what their may look like today but why they were taken , who took them and is it possible that they 're living a life without them .
BC	Forgive me . Go ahead . . so even though that community has been established there for quite a while , it has internal problems to do with leadership . It has a sense of actually thinking that many of the first generation did n't actually want to accept this as their country . They came for a specific reason and then to go back . And so two generations on , we 've inherited a little bit of kind of unclear ideas about who we are , and into that , that ideology , those seeds have been planted . People have arrived with those ideologies . They 're not inherently something that the people locally came up with , the younger people , came up with those conclusions themselves , but it 's a badge that 's been given to them . What should Muslims of all stripes expect from non-Muslims ? Should the rest of Britain wait patiently while a tiny handful -- and once again , it 's a tiny handful -- of young men decide whose side they want to be on ? I think the first thing we need to do is consider ourselves as Britons or we need to consider ourselves as human beings , and there is a sense of this is not going to be tackled by actually saying , well , the Muslims are on this side or the British public is on the other side . I am also a member of the British public , and I think I do n't expect anybody to wait for a generation to grow up . We are facing a crisis . We have seen what happened last year . We have to deal with these things now . The politicians are very aware , community leaders are very aware , of where the wart is and where they have n't even focused on that . I think what you are going to see , and I think it 's already beginning , is there is an empowerment of younger voices , and women in particular , and that 's where the natural leadership will emerge , and then from within those communities , workable solutions will arrive , not committees and groups that meet in White Hall or kind of issue edicts in terms of how people should behave or integrate . That has to come from those people themselves , and I think it is beginning to happen . I 'm quite confident about that . Navid Akhtar , thanks so much for this . We 're going to take a break . When we come back , on that very point , talking to someone who is trying to ease tensions around a pool table . Stay with us . Walthamstow is an ordinary working-class community in northeast London , but after last August 's discovery of the plot to blow up airliners traveling from the U.K. , police descended . They arrested 14 men with a raid that startled the neighborhood , to say the least . Welcome back . Like the rest of London , Muslims make up about 15 percent of that corner of the city . Most of them were born in Britain of Pakistani descent . Muslims have been elected to the mayor 's office of Walthamstow and to parliament there . But it too found itself some kind of battleground in the war on terror and it 's where one youth worker , Hanif Qadir , went to work .
BC	The Bush administration is pushing and pushing hard a partnership between the United States and Mexico and Canada , with a goal of what it calls integration by 2010 . This partnership among three nations is being discussed at the highest levels of the three governments at the urging of the largest multinational corporations , but it is barreling ahead with absolutely no congressional oversight , no voter approval , out of sight completely of the American people . And as far as we can determine , without any constitutional authority whatsoever . Christine Romans reports . ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) Congressman Virgil Goode wants to stop the Security and Prosperity Partnership . It will lead to a union between Canada , the United States , and Mexico . And it will greatly harm the sovereignty of the United States . It is part of the open borders philosophy to do away with borders . And I vigorously oppose it . Launched in 2005 , it 's a dramatic government and business effort to "harmonize regulations . " The president promised , no matter who the players are in Washington , Mexico City and Ottawa , this bureaucracy is meant to endure . And I appreciate the commitment of the prime minister and the president toward a spirit of partnership to outlast whatever politics may occur . To critics , outlasting politics means skirting Congress and the will of the American people in secrecy . It took a Freedom of Information request to find out what happened last fall . Closed to the press , the North America forum was attended by the highest levels of business in government . The conservative group Judicial Watch found ... This is a forum where the push is for taxes , the push is for open borders . The push is for investment funds for Mexico . So all the talk is on one side of the equation . Among the notes the Pentagon released of meeting , a goal of integration and " Open borders for industry and investment . North America needs to be more competitive , and yet security goals seem to interfere with this outcome . " And the admission , " Most people (are ) not compelled by North America integration need to identify steps that demonstrate the concept and success . " Numerous documents advocate open borders between and a secure perimeter around the three countries , taking what 's called a continental vision . It is a vision Congressman Goode does not share . He will introduce this week a resolution opposing the Security and Prosperity Partnership -- Lou . And some mindless and uninformed before suggesting that this is not even occurring . I saw a number of articles suggesting whether it 's North American Union just is n't happening . It 's a fiction as some wild conspiracy theory , yet it is absolutely documented , this administration continues to deny what is happening right in front of us , although it is happening with stealth and with secrecy , it 's happening . The administration has a Web site called spp.gov. It outlines myths and realities . People can check it out themselves but there are a lot of questions about this , Lou . You can check out our Web site , too , which is about truth . We 'll let the administration have its own view of that truth . And fortunately it seems to be one that they do n't want to share with a lot of Americans for some reason . This is a very important story .
BC	Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez touting his 21st century socialism at a meeting with Latin American leaders in Rio . At home , his grip on power tightens , manipulating democratic institutions to do so . His congress moving to grant him 18 months of unlimited power . His opponents in politics and the media sidelined . MOISES NAIM , EDITOR , " FOREIGN POLICY" : He has been an innovator , nonetheless , in using the tools of democracy to grab power , and creating a hegemony of his party and his person . University of Miami professor Jaime Suchlicki said Chavez and his socialist ideology will be a challenge for American foreign policy in the region for decades to come . We do n't have a sustained foreign policy in Latin America , which we should have . It is important that we have a long-term , sustained policy to Latin America , not one that flares up every time there is a crisis and then dies after . The State Department says under President Bush foreign aid to Latin America has more than doubled to $ 1.7 billion last year . Its policy is to look past Chavez 's stage craft and focus on the rest of the region . Our focus is not worrying about him or his comments . Our focus is on working with our partners in the hemisphere to do the kinds of things that is generally agreed by all members of the OAS that we want to see happen . But Chavez is spreading around more than just anti-U.S. rhetoric . Professor Suchlicki estimates Chavez spent $ 2.3 billion last year to support Castro alone , using his country 's vast oil wealth to buy influence and spread anti-American sentiment . For many her in Miami , Castro and communist Cuba are the top foreign policy priority , but the reality is Chavez , with his vast oil wealth , is the greatest threat right now in this hemisphere -- Lou . And the State Department , as timid as it always is , and sometimes absolutely indecipherable , has no response to the fact that Venezuela now has a dictator ? Venezuela essentially has a dictator , and today Tom Casey at the State Department did say it was curious that he was using democratic institutions to consolidate his grip on power . " Curious " is the word they used . Curious ? Curious ? Inspiring . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . Christine Romans . Unbelievable . Jaime Suchlicki , whom you just saw in Christine 's report , will join us here later in the broadcast as we discuss the rising leftist and Communist threat in the Western hemisphere and the failure of U.S. policy response . Let 's take a look at some of your thoughts now . Jeffrey in Washington said , " Lou , it is really a travesty when the government rewards a government official with benefits while in prison after they 've committed felonies and then turns around and ruins the lives of both these border patrol agents and their families for doing their jobs . This government should be ashamed of themselves . " Bill in Pennsylvania , " It 's really not a question whether President Bush should feel ashamed of his actions . Clearly his arrogance does not allow him to have a conscience beyond his corporate self-interest . I know one thing though -- I am ashamed I voted for him .
BC	Straw buyers are situations where people are offered money in order for -- to use their identities in real estate transactions . And this is , of course , not legal . If you 're going to purchase a home , you have to intend to make the mortgage payments , not intend that somebody else is going to make them . And we see straw buyers -- they 're offered usually somewhere between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 to use their credit . It 's portrayed as a no risk sort of a transaction for them . But , of course , if the people who are actually supposed to be responsible for the mortgage do n't make the payments , then it 's that ultimate person who signs on the bottom line that ends up responsible , and their credit 's the one that 's destroyed . Well , Rachel , of course , people really want to watch out for this . And the targets are typically the elderly , first-time home buyers . We could go on and on here , but we 're really out of time . Rachel , thank you so much for your time . Thank you , Gerri . Still ahead on OPEN HOUSE , breaking into a sweat without breaking the bank . We 'll tell you how to build an affordable gym right in your house . And you see the wild high-tech advances for your home available in the future . Well , guess what ? The future is right now . We 'll explain . But first , your mortgage numbers . Working out is usually at the top of the list of New Year 's resolutions , but busy schedules and expensive gym fees , well , it can all make it really hard to follow through . So we put together the perfect home gym , where you can burn calories without burning your budget . Everybody wants a home gym , but what if I do n't have a lot of money to spend ? Say , only $ 500 . What can I get ? For $ 500 , you can get some very basic tools . You can get , for example , a foam roller , which is really good for loosening up a lot of the muscle tissue around the joint . Like this ? Right . And put your hips right up here . Put your hips ... This is my kind of exercise . Put your hips right up on this . I get to lay down . This is called a Swiss ( ph ) ball . And basically , it 's a rubberized ball that you can load up with air and you can do a variety of things on it . You know , I have one of these . I do n't really know what you do with it . OK . You can use it to add a little bit more complexity to a basic exercise . Like , let 's say it 's a crunch . So why do n't you lie down on the ball . Thanks . I get to do this . OK . They 're very inexpensive . These generally run somewhere around $ 30 or so . These are called body bars , and basically think of them -- like barbells but rubberized . So you can lie down on the bench , you can do a basic bench press . That 's probably the lowest cost cardiovascular exercise you can do -- next to running , of course , which costs nothing .
BC	He and others think the president has failed that test , to tell the country , look , the economy is doing OK at home , you 're all going about your business , but there 's 150,000 of your sons and daughters in Iraq fighting a war and whether you agree with me or disagree with me , you need to rally . You need to stick with them . That is one test that many of the people in these communities that are so close to the military think the president has failed . They would like to hear more of that from the president , saying even if you 're against me , help out . We 're one country . We need to support these young men and women . We 'll take a break . And when we come back , we 'll meet the newly announced candidate for the Democratic nomination , Governor Bill Richardson . He 'll come to us from Santa Fe , New Mexico . And then our panel will rejoin us . But as we go to break , we 're going to enlist James Carville 's services . We 're going to send him out to Hollywood Boulevard and Highland -- it 's about five-and-a-half minutes from here -- and have James talk to every folk . He does n't mingle much with everyday folk so we 'll see how he takes to this . James , you 're on . Ah , OK , Larry . I 'm dispatching out of here . Go get 'em , Mr. Carville . All right . Thank you , sir . Good luck in the wilds of Hollywood . That 's it . I 've got on -- see I 've worn blue tonight because that 's -- this will probably be the bluest place in America I 'm going . There he goes . Wish him luck . All right . Mr. Carville on the road . I 'll get to Hollywood Boulevard . We 're asking about the State of the Union Address . What do you expect to hear ? Are you excited about this ? Well , I guess , I mean , as an American , I guess you could say I 'm excited . But I hope what to expect , like Bush will say some new stuff , like his new attempt in Iraq , I guess . So hopefully it will be something good to hear . What do you expect ? Nothing too much , to tell you the truth . You 're not excited about this speech ? I do n't believe anything he 's going to say will endear me to him at all . We now welcome to LARRY KING LIVE Governor Bill Richardson , Democrat of New Mexico , who has jut set up an exploratory committee for the 2008 presidential bid . Former United States ambassador to the U.N. and former energy secretary . He 's in Santa Fe , New Mexico . He 's governor , of course , of New Mexico . Bill , Governor , some pundits said today that you 're running for vice president , and you will handle this adroitly through all of this , and what you will bring to the ticket is the four Southwestern states . Larry , I 'm running for president . And I want to be president , because I think this country needs to be unified . There 's too much division . I have got the experience , the foreign policy , energy experience . I have created jobs , health care in New Mexico .
BC	Happening this morning . Confirmation hearings today for David Petraeus , the general tapped to lead the war in Iraq . Petraeus to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee . If confirmed , he will succeed General George Casey , soon to be the new Army chief of staff . Opening statements expected today in the trial of Lewis Scooter Libby . The jury selection is all done . Libby is the former chief of staff for Vice President Cheney . He is charged with lying to investigators as they tried to find out who leaked the name of a CIA agent to reporters in 2003 . Cheney is expected to testify . And snow on the ( INAUDIBLE) . check out these pictures from Tucson , Arizona . You heard me right , Tucson , Arizona ! Fun for the kids , but dense fog and icy roads no treat at all for the drivers there . About two inches of snow there . More than a foot fell in the northern part of the state -- Soledad . That was a pretty good looking snowman they had going there . They did all right . Yes , that was pretty good . They were loving that . I bet they were . Talk about a snow day . President Bush prepares to deliver his State of the Union speech . A new CNN-Opinion Research Corporation poll shows that more Americans than ever are concerned about the president 's ability to lead . Our senior political analyst , Bill Schneider , has our report . President Bush will be addressing a skeptical audience , not just the new Democratic Congress , but also the American people . At 34 percent approval , Mr. Bush has the lowest job rating of any president on record going into his next to last year in office . Most Americans now call the Bush presidency a failure . Remember the issue that brought down his father ? This time , it 's not the economy , stupid . More than 60 percent of Americans believe the nation 's economy is in good shape . But Americans are strongly opposed to President Bush 's policies in Iraq . More than 60 percent oppose his troop increase and want Congress to try and stop it . Disillusionment with Iraq is having a spillover effect . Only 28 percent of Americans now believe the United States and its allies are winning the war on terror . The lowest number ever . Most Americans say neither side is winning . President Bush 's father learned that even a brilliant foreign policy success cannot save you if the economy falls apart . President Lyndon Johnson learned that a foreign policy disaster can destroy you , even if you have a strong domestic record . It 's a lesson President Bush may learn , too . Bill Schneider , CNN, Washington . You 'll want to keep it right here on AMERICAN MORNING. White House Press Secretary Tony Snow is going to join us live at 7:30 a.m. Eastern . Then we 're going to talk to New York senator and Democratic presidential candidate , Hillary Rodham Clinton . She 'll join us live right here . CNN has the best political team on TV . Our live primetime coverage of tonight 's State of the Union Address begins at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time . That 's going to carry right into our next edition of AMERICAN MORNING. We 're starting at a special time tomorrow , 5:00 a.m. Eastern .
BC	Now , there are two main components to this plan , the first , as I said , increasing our use of alternative fuels . Bush proposing to increase our use of ethanol , which is made from corn and biodiesel , by 35 billion gallons by the year 2017 . And that will reduce our gasoline consumption by 15 percent . And then , second , he wants to raise auto mileage standards by 4 percent every year and that will amount for the other 5 percent of the 20 percent desired gasoline consumption reduction . Now , automakers , of course , might not be too happy about this , although Ford does say it supports standards at maximum feasible levels . Beyond these two ideas Bush also pushing some other energy sources as well . It 's in our vital interests to diversify America 's energy supply . The way forward is through technology . We must continue changing the way America generates electric power , by even greater use of clean coal technology , solar and wind energy , and clean , safe , nuclear power . Now , Soledad , two potential challenges to this use of ethanol which , as I said , earlier is made from corn . Number one , there is n't enough corn in the U.S. to make all the ethanol that the White House wants to use . Number two , the more ethanol on the market , your are increasing supply , the lower the oil prices . So , the more ethanol , that will influence oil prices to come down and so that really , Soledad , undermines the whole idea of not using as much oil in the first place . It would raise prices for other goods elsewhere . All right , Carrie , thank you very much for that update . The top stories of the morning are coming up next , including our AMERICAN MORNING " Fact Check" . What you might expect from the president 's plans to fix health care , and his call , as you just heard from Carrie , to save energy . We will take a closer look at those proposals . Plus the views of three veterans of the war in Iraq . Straight ahead on AMERICAN MORNING. The most news in the morning is right here on CNN. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq and I ask you to give it a chance to work . I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way . Reaching out , President Bush appealing to newly empowered Democrats in his state of the union address . We 're looking for specifics for you , about the president 's ideas on Iraq , health care and energy on this AMERICAN MORNING. Good morning to you , it is Wednesday , January 24th , I 'm Miles O'Brien on Capitol Hill , special edition of AMERICAN MORNING this morning . Good morning , Soledad . Good morning to you , Miles . I 'm Soledad O'Brien in New York this morning . Thanks for being with us . We have already heard from one key member of Congress about what he thought of President Bush 's state of the union address . Just moments ago I spoke with the Illinois senator and also presidential hopeful Barack Obama . Here 's what he said .
BC	There was definitely an initial period where this child was terrorized , traumatized , made to feel completely helpless . But there was one report I read where a neighbor asked Devlin to turn down the volume of noise in his apartment and what Devlin did is he went and keyed the guy` s car in the middle of the night . When he saw the neighbor the next day , he ran away scared . So that tells me about Devlin that he` s the kind of guy who likes to do things in secret , he likes to have absolute power and control , quite vengeful individual . Tonight a lot happening in the Devlin case . Number one , you see the FBI and local police in and out of 41-year-old Michael Devlin` s apartment , taking things out , marked as evidence . They`ve got the bed frame , the bed , the bed mattress , and many other boxes shrouded in brown paper and marked , taped up , being removed in that trailer , apparently , from the apartment . Will that evidence make it to trial ? Let` s unleash the lawyers . Joining us tonight , John Burris out of the San Francisco jurisdiction , a veteran trial lawyer and author . Out of Atlanta , Raymond Giudice also a veteran trial lawyer . To you John Burris , on the kidnap charge you do n` t have to prove in court that you held a gun to somebody` s head for the next four years . It does n` t require that to show kidnapping under the law . And will every day be an additional false imprisonment charge ? How will it work , John ? Well , you`re right . You do n` t have to have a gun to a person` s head or use force every day in order to maintain a kidnapping charge . But I have n` t seen a case , though , where every day represents another false imprisonment type charge . I just have n` t seen that . It is enough . Obviously , kidnapping is a severe enough crime in and of itself . What does it carry in California ? Life ? It could be a life sentence . No doubt about it . Now , I know there` s this argument , and it probably will not play , but if I` m the defense lawyer I` m really looking to see what I can find out about the relationship , who this kid was . I do n` t know that I`d be able to do much with the whole question of consent or anything . But at the same time , you know , you`ve got to find out what you can do here . You know , you have the defense lawyer faced with a very nasty case . It looks like -- Well , look at these photos , John and Ray . I mean , these photos will come in front of a jury , and they`ll show the boy looking happy and smiling . That means absolutely nothing in a court of law . What matters is what happened the day the boy was abducted . That` s right , Nancy . You ca n` t put the kidnapping back in the bottle . John` s exactly right . I really think what John` s going towards is you`re looking at mitigation at sentencing on this to show that yes , there was a kidnapping , there was -- assuming there` s no facts of sexual molestation , and we do n` t know anything about that yet from what I understand , but at least then you can go to sentencing and say hopefully this is not a case where there` s great harm to this young man --
BC	Oh , my pleasure . Thank you . The formation broke apart at 4,000 feet , allowing each diver to open their main chute . The head of the club says one of the group then saw Van Doren desperately pulling on her reserve . The death plunge ended in a garden close to the drop zone . My neighbor was standing in her garden , and all of a sudden , something fell from the sky and she went looking . She sees something lying in the bushes . Turns out it 's the woman whose parachute did n't open . Tonight : Murder at 13,000 feet . It 's called murder in the sky . And is the motive a love triangle ? Pat Lalama , what happened ? Well , first , I want to tell you I 'm going to go register the following title with the Writers Guild , " Air Affair : Broken Hearts , Broken Strings . " What do you think ? Like it . OK , good . Anyway , here 's the -- it 's not really anything to laugh about . It 's one of the most heinous cases I 've heard about . Here 's the story . There is a man named Marcel , and he 's apparently a Dutch guy . Marcel has a girlfriend . She 's also a skydiver . The girlfriend , the 22- year-old , Els Clottemans , finds out that Els Van Doren , another member of the skydiving club -- a married woman , by the way , a mother of two -- is also having an affair with Marcel . So the cops think that the first Els clipped the strings and sabotaged her so she 'd fall 13,000 feet and die . Both her main parachute and here reserve parachute have been tampered with , the first by binding it and the second by cutting the strings . She died after a spectacular fall . Was it murder at 13,000 feet ? Many people are calling it murder in the sky . Police now believe motive was a love triangle . Back to you , Pat Lalama . You were saying that this may be over a guy , Marcel , that was within the parachute club ? Yeah , Nancy , as a matter of fact they were all in the same club and here 's what really is so amazing to think about . Imagine this . They all do the jump together . You know how they do , they hold -- I would never do it , but they 're all holding hands . Marcel and the defendant , the suspect , break away , and there goes the ( INAUDIBLE) , the married woman who he was having the affair with , tumbling down . And what 's really sickening , she has a video camera on top of her head gear . You actually can see her struggling to try to make it . I mean , I ca n't imagine anything more horrendous . And the suspect , apparently there was a case where she once tried to run a previous boyfriend down and now cops say that they believe she tried to commit suicide . What they 're looking for to really get the case penned in is some DNA evidence that they can find . They 're looking for a piece of ribbon somewhere on the ground that may help them further determine . But they pretty much believe it was her .
BC	The only thing that saved Cuomo 's life and that of his two ABC crewmembers was the armored plating on their Humvee . That , and the American soldiers who got him to safety after a group of insurgents opened small arms fire . The close call came one year after ABC anchor Bob Woodruff was badly injured by a roadside bomb in Iraq . " I 'm trying to deal with it like a soldier , " Cuomo told me . " Just do my job . " A former " New York Post " gossip columnist is off the legal hook . Jared Paul Stern , who wrote for the tabloid 's " Page Six , " learned this week that he will not be charged for his aggressive dealings with a California billionaire . Supermarket mogul Ron Burkle secretly taped Stern last year asking for a $ 100,000 payment and a $ 10,000 monthly stipend in exchange for keeping unfavorable mentions of Burkle out of " The Post . " Stern says he wanted Burkle , who , by the way , is now trying to buy the " L.A. Times , " to invest in a clothing line , but does not deny he offered P.R. advice as well . The whole thing stunk , but federal prosecutors do n't see a criminal case . Finally , there 's a whiff of something strange here , but " The Wall Street Journal " is planning some scratch-and-sniff ads . According to Advertising Age , you use your finger and get the aroma of perfume or chocolate . Smell funny to you ? Anything for a buck these days . Ahead in the second half hour of RELIABLE SOURCES , Dick Cheney takes offense at Wolf Blitzer 's question about his gay daughter 's pregnancy . Is Mary Cheney 's personal life fair game in a vice presidential interview ? And ABC 's " Grey " problem . Is the network responsible for a cast member 's anti-gay slurs ? KURTZ. Welcome back . Let 's get right to it . Joining us now to talk about several television controversies , David Zurawik , television critic for " The Baltimore Sun , " and David Folkenflik , media correspondent for National Public Radio . You 've probably seen the video by now , Vice President Cheney and Wolf Blitzer in " THE SITUATION ROOM" this week , a contentious interview and some particularly awkward moments prompted by this question ... Your daughter Mary , she 's pregnant . All of us are happy . She 's going to have a baby . You 're going to have another grandchild . Some of the -- some critics , though , are suggesting -- for example , a statement from someone representing Focus on the Family , " Mary Cheney 's pregnancy raises the question of what 's best for children . Just because it 's possible to conceive a child outside of the relationship of a married mother and father does n't mean it 's best for the child . " Do you want to respond to that ? No, I do n't . She 's obviously a good daughter . I 've interviewed her . I 'm delighted -- I 'm delighted I 'm about to have a sixth grandchild , Wolf , and obviously I think the world of both my daughters and all of my grandchildren . And I think , frankly , you 're out of line with that question . David Zurich , was Wolf Blitzer out of bounds ? DAVID ZURAWIK , "BALTIMORE SUN" : I do n't think he was . You know , and the thing that I was reminded as soon as I heard this was , back in October , just on the eve of the midterm elections , when Lynne Cheney did the same thing essentially with Wolf Blitzer -- and it was a very contentious thing -- you know , I think this is a political strategy . If you heard that exchange and then saw the blogs the next day , right - wing blogs saw the same pattern this time .
BC	What about fat kids ? It has an impact . What about fat kids ? We have to get in people 's minds . We ca n't legislate it . All right . We have got a lot more to cover with you tonight . Please stay with us . We move next to a shocking assault against Palestinian students at a Quaker college in North Carolina . Was it a racial attack ? Reports say those that were hurt were accused of being terrorists . Also tonight , a police chief accused of racial intolerance by eight of his high-ranking officers -- we will get to that when we come back . A chilling attack is sending shockwaves across a campus founded on Quaker values of tolerance , and bringing allegations of racism right out into the open . Today , a sixth football player at Guilford College in Greensboro , North Carolina , was charged with beating one of three Palestinian students a little more than a week ago . The victims say they were singled out for their Middle Eastern looks . Dan Lothian has more on the allegations the local Islamic Center calls racism and hatred it has never experienced before . The Guilford College campus in Greensboro , North Carolina , is a peaceful setting , a Quaker school , proud of its values . Anything violent at Guilford College , really , it runs counter to the Quaker testimonies , to our heritage . Now that 's being tested like never before . What 's described as a racially-charged fight outside this dorm has led to protests , rallies , and criminal charges . I 'm hurt . I 'm angry about it . According to court documents and a lawyer representing the alleged victims , three Palestinian students , including one visiting from nearby North Carolina State , were taunted and attacked by members of Guilford 's football team as they left the dorm . They say they were called "terrorists " and other racial slurs , and were kicked , pushed , and punched with brass knuckles , suffering concussions and fractures . They were minding their own business . It was unprovoked . They did n't want this . They do n't want this . One of the alleged victims told a local paper -- quote -- " It was the most horrific experience of my life . " Based only on the complaints , six football players have been charged with assault , five of them also with ethnic intimidation . No one is talking publicly . But the father of one , Michael Bates , denied the fight was motivated by hate . This is not a hate crime . And this -- this is college students that had a -- a ruckus that lasted five minutes . Bates says , the players were provoked by their accuser , and were also victims . He showed pictures of Michael Six , one of the suspects . The belt marks , a couple on his neck , the one in the middle of his back , of course , on his sides . Any injuries sustained by any of the attackers would have been in self-defense . The fight has now divided this small college . Deena Zaru , a Palestinian student who knows one of the alleged victims , feels like she 's now getting the cold shoulder . I feel like people that used to -- I used to talk to or say hi to or , " How are you ? " that does n't happen anymore with some of them . And they 're a lot more distant .
BC	So he did n` t want to be party guy anymore . He wanted to just be a working actor who had a family . So he found a woman who understood his need to work and be in the business , but who was also willing to settle down and have a normal life and give kids a normal life . Another couple , been together a long time , celeb-non-celeb , Chris O` Donnell , wife Caroline Fentress . They`ve been together almost 10 years . They have four kids . She` s an elementary school teacher . So she` s totally not in the business , completely removed . Do you - do you think they work out well because they`re not competing for fame ? Absolutely . That` s the hardest thing . Because someone like Chris O` Donnell , where he` s done such huge things , yet he` s not - he` s famous , but he` s not , like , ridiculous famous . So he` s able to keep a little bit of anonymity , and not be with somebody who` s competing against , How famous are you ? How famous am I ? Are they after us ? Is the paparazzi here ? He` s able to , again , be a working actor and have a family . Well , thank you for giving us some insight into why these celeb-non-celeb marriages work . Cooper Lawrence , always good to see you .

BC	We did n't get this one from eBay , though we noticed that some of them are actually on sale on eBay right now . One seller will apparently hand over this outer space delinquent if you shell out more than $ 2,000 . CNN 's Gary Tuchman joins us with a 360 news and business bulletin -- Gary . Anderson , hello to you . It 's a chilly night here in the Southeast . A winter storm blanketed parts of the western Carolinas and north Georgia today . Up to four inches of show fell in some spots . Schools were closed , and flights were grounded at area airports . More than 2,000 homes and businesses lost power in North Carolina . On Wall Street , a record day -- the Dow hit a new high , 12673 , up 52 points . The Nasdaq added nearly five . And the S&P gained seven points . ExxonMobil posted a record $ 39.5 billion in profits in 2006 , the largest ever by any U.S. company . You do the math , that 's about $ 4.5 million an hour . And here 's something you rarely hear about , a thief with a conscience . Joanne Robinson lost her purse containing her will , $ 12,000 in bonds , and two rings at a Kansas supermarket nine months ago . Last week , the purse arrived in the mail with all of its contents , including a money order for the $ 89.20 in cash the thief took from the purse . The sender included a note explaining why he kept the purse and asking for forgiveness . Anderson ... Wow . ... that is my kind of thief . That 's amazing . Some guilty pleasures coming up -- the question is , will they make you fit or fat ? 360 M.D. Dr. Gupta answering your e-mails about exercise and diet . Also : a story tonight that will , well , certainly ruin your appetite . A seventh-grader with a secret . I do n't understand how a 29-year-old male can be misunderstood as a seventh-grader . Good question , because police say he was a sexual predator . And that 's not the half of it . Wait until you hear about his so-called family -- ahead on 360 . Pulled over and pregnant and bleeding . She just gave me a long line of excuses , says she 's bleeding . She says she belonged in the hospital . They gave her a cell . Now she 's taking them to court -- ahead on 360 . The video you 're seeing right there was shot by CNN 's Michael Ware when he was embedded with American forces in Ramadi . Coming up in the next hour of 360 , Michael brings you to the stories you have n't heard about the war . He says there are actually four wars in Iraq , not just one . He 'll lay it all out for us . We 're devoting the whole hour , our next hour to the conversation with Michael Ware . You 'll also hear about his close brush with death . Listen . These men intercepted my vehicle and , with grenades with the pins pulled so that they were live , pulled me from the car and with my own video camera , now preparing to film my execution . How Michael escaped and his unparalleled insight in Iraq . What you need to know . It 's an encore of our special , " Iraq : The Hidden Wars " . It starts at 11 p.m. We really got hundreds of e- mails from -- we aired this once before , hundreds of e-mails from people saying it was the best explanation they have heard about the war in Iraq .
BC	Twelve . For what ? For what ? Well , OK . All right . First of all , did -- do we know yet if they made the 911 call ? No, that is one of the speculation that` s out there , but it goes against the evidence that we`ve seen here in Boston thus far . If that` s the case , in other words , if there was a bomb scare , then I get it . Wait a minute . There was a bomb scare . No, wait , wait , wait . From what I understand , not related to this ... Yes . ... there was another real bomb scare going on at the same time . Now , let me ask you . If there was a bomb scare going on in Boston and one of these things would have been a real bomb , would n` t you -- and they did n` t shut the city down -- would n` t you be the guy who is saying , why did n` t you shut the tunnels down ? No, because if you go and look at the bomb and it` s a bomb as opposed to a Lite-Brite , then of course you act in a different way . They would never bomb -- they were never close to bombs . You ca n` t treat a toy like a bomb . I know the terrorists at Hasbro are about to unleash a Mr. Milton Bradley on the city of Boston who will terrorize us for years . Right . Wait a minute . What happens -- then we just taught al Qaeda what to do . All you do is you go get the game " Operation " and you put -- you put explosives behind the guy` s nose , tape it to a bridge and people like you will say , no big deal . You can laugh but there` s a Hi-Ho Cheerio sitting in my trunk right now . I` m too scared to go out to my own car . But if you look at the device , we`ve all seen -- there was no place to hide an explosive . And Glenn , remember something , they shut down river traffic on the entire Charles River for a device the size of a notebook . If the thing was pure uranium it could n` t blow up a boat on the Charles River . I live in New York City , man . I take no chances with Lite- Brites or not Lite-Brites . Thanks . " Real Story " on France and Iran next . You do n` t want to miss it , coming up . All right , welcome to " The Real Story . " People ask me a lot , why should I even vote ? " Gee , Glenn , we do n` t even make a difference anymore . " Well , actually , that` s not so . Last week , I brought you a story about how our own military has been selling spare F-14 parts to Iran . You know , now even though I` m not normally the rah-rah , call your congressman type of guy , this time I did say , " Can you please make a call and ask them to stop selling spare parts to our enemies ? " Well , this week , the Pentagon announced an end to the insanity . No more jet parts to our enemy will be sold . So the real story is tonight , people still do make a difference . You just did .
BC	Well , it does if the home were going to be savable , but this home 's going to the trash dumpster . It 's done . It 's done . There 's no hope for this house . There 's no way . And interestingly enough , back to the tie-down straps , you see the strap inside the wall underneath the aluminum ? It goes up over the top . This one held , but the unit still blew apart . And you can see these ... Those are ... ... like a foot interval , a foot and a half interval . That 's where the roof is tied to the walls . The ones that go over the top go up through the walls , and they should be on about five-foot centers . OK . So , you know , here 's one right next to one that blew apart . Right . And on the other side , they blew apart . So this one stayed , but it still was destroyed , and this is 2 x 4 construction . Which is what it 's supposed to be . What it 's supposed to be . All right . But , you know , what 's amazing to me is you see the siding that 's been ripped away by the winds here . Right . All of the siding . It looks like wallpaper maybe down here , chairs , cushions from some kind of seating . It 's just heartbreaking really to see . I mean , look , you know , all these small things ... All the little keepsakes . ... that people think of as being their home . So here we see a big hole where something was . Here we see a big hole where we can see the concrete blocks that the home was mounted -- sitting on top of . We saw on the side , that tie-down strap again that went over the top of the unit . It broke . The anchor appears to even be gone from over here . Do you think this was a house , or was this a garage ? Oh , this was a House , because I think the garage was right over here . The car 's off the driveway into where the house was . So it was lifted up and moved as well , just as the house was . It was lifted up . Yes . This would have been the entrance right here . This would have been the entrance . Right here . Here 's where you would have come through the front door right into the house . And you can get a sense here of the size and the shape of it . Yes . Now , this one did have straps . It had some anyway that we see . We do n't see an awful lot of them . That 's a little surprising . So sad to see what 's going on there with people 's houses destroyed . I have to report to you that Bill York said these tie- downs that he showed you just a second ago , while they exist in that community , they are n't necessarily up to code . They 're too far apart . So he had some concerns about the construction there . But right now I want to toss it back to Atlanta . T.J. has some breaking news you 'll definitely want to hear . All right , Gerri . Thank you so much .
BC	New audio recordings tonight of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger . The good governor compares the Mexican border fence to the Berlin Wall . And he expresses sympathy for illegal aliens . The recordings were made during staff meetings . They were obtained by the " Los Angeles Times . " And amongst the things the good governor said , " We always looked at the ( Berlin ) Wall as kind of like the outside of the wall is the enemy ...Are we looking at Mexico as the enemy ? No, it 's not...These are our trading partners . " The governor also said he believes Mexicans have trouble assimilating because they 're so close to their own country . He had a lot more to say , and we 're going to have some more of his quotes here coming up in the next 15 minutes . Coming up next , however , ice cold winds and plunging temperatures are causing an arctic freeze across much of the country . We 'll have the latest for you . Also , time is running out on the president 's fast track trade authority . Senator Byron Dorgan says , great . And he wants to defeat any attempt to extend the policy . He joins us . A Lear jet simply not big enough for the new speaker of the House . We 'll be talking about the latest on the request for special privileges . The lady of the house . Stay with us . In the last half hour , Senate Republicans blocked the debate on a resolution criticizing the president 's troop increase in Iraq . Democrats immediately said they would seek a new way to force President Bush to change his strategy in Iraq . In other news tonight , damage assessment and cleanup under way in central Florida where tornadoes killed 20 people . The National Weather Service says there were three tornadoes that touched down early Friday with peak winds above 155 miles an hour . Federal disaster assistance 's is now on its way to residents of four Florida counties . The cost of the storm is estimated at about $ 70 million . Much the northeastern United States tonight is in the grip a bone-chilling arctic cold wave . Wind chills , low as 42 below zero , closing schools in states around the Great Lakes . The dangerous cold also brought heavy snow in northwestern New York . Whiteout conditions forced the closure of the New York Throughway , and Amtrak shut down some of its passenger service . A key ruling in the CIA leak trial is being hailed as a victory for the national news media . The judge in the trial of Lewis " Scooter " Libby says he 'll release audio recordings of Libby 's secret grand jury testimony . The release would come after jurors finished listening to those tapes . Defense attorneys objecting , saying it would seriously threaten Libby 's right to a fair trial . Former New York mayor , Rudy Giuliani , has joined of what is a growing list of Republicans in the race for the Republican nomination . Giuliani filed a statement of candidacy for president today . The latest Opinion Research Corporation poll shows Giuliani leads the pack on the Republican side , beating out Senator John McCain , with Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney running a distant third and fourth .
BC	We also found , you know , information on how to get to Colleen Shipman 's house and we recovered in her car a , you know , rubber tubing , latex gloves , a knife with a serrated edge and a steel mallet that -- they were all brand new items with some of the packaging still available . Will the astronauts , Buzz , stand by her ? I think so . I 'm reminded of a phrase , and I 'm just not sure how it applies here , but it 's worth thinking about , that hell hath no fury like a scorned woman . And that 's got to play a role in here . And I understand that -- that there were some allegations of previous stalking type activities . By her ? Yes . Yes . Have you heard that ? I heard that . Had you heard that , John Zarrella , that there have been previous kind of stories about her ? Yes . That -- well , what came out today also was that Colleen Shipman had filed a restraining order on the fifth of this month against Lisa Nowak , alleging that Lisa Nowak had been stalking her for two months , although the two had never apparently met . Now , it also came out this afternoon , Larry , that , you know , her family issued a statement saying this was very much out of character . This is from her sister and her parents in Maryland , that they could not understand this at all , very much out of character . But also it came out that she is apparently -- that is Nowak has apparently been separated now for several weeks from her husband , who either now -- Miles may be able to correct me on this if I 'm wrong -- worked for or in mission control at the Johnson Space Center . Is that right , Miles ? That 's right , yes . He also has some Navy lineage and I 'm told that he is a flight controller at the mission control at the Space Center . So , it just came to light to us just an hour or so ago from the family that they had been separated . So that was news to us . And he has n't said anything , right ? He has n't said anything , no . Well , Buzz , we thank you for joining us . But before you leave , where is this going to go , do you think ? Well , you know , we were looking before at are there ways of detecting something by somebody 's early childhood or how they behaved before , let 's say , getting to the Navy , going to the Naval Academy or before being selected . It strikes me that we 're dealing with something that has to do with supervision after people are part of the astronaut business . And I really hate to raise that , but it seems to me that there needs to be a little bit more oversight somehow . And I do n't know how to carry it out , but this is certainly an indication that had somebody been overseeing the performance of people under their jurisdiction a little closer , maybe they could have dictated -- or detected this and then maybe issued a warning of some sort , hey , it 's time to cool it , or whatever .
BC	They 've always been thin , but some of the models on the catwalk these days are not just skinny , they 're down right skeletal . LINDA WELLS , EDITOR-IN-CHIEF , " ALLURE" : I see bones . I do n't like the idea of a knee being the largest part of the body . I do n't want to see and count people 's rib bones . When this Brazilian model , Anna Carolina Reston , died last year of complications related to anorexia , she weighed just 88 pounds . It was front-page news , and the fashion industry responded introducing health requirements for models in parts of Europe . New York responded , too . No models under 16 on the runway . Models with eating disorders are ordered to get help . Designers are encouraged to feed the models back stage . The problem is these are guidelines , and designers are free to do as they please . At least one designer has resorted to weighing models . What we 're looking for here -- Betsy Johnson says that 's not her style . There is a healthier approach , and I think that 's good , but treating the girls like jockeys , or sports figures , making them weigh in , oh , I think that 's horrible . Many in the industry believe the real issue is not weight , but age . With models as young as 13 on the runway , editors say , of course , they 're thin . They 're not fully grown . Actress Rachel Welch , who at 66 is MAC cosmetics new beauty icon , says she does n't fault the model . She blames designers for not making clothes big enough for the average woman . Nothing fits . You ca n't get the zippers up . You say , well , are they just -- they just do n't want me ? The models themselves ? They say we should focus less on super skinny and more on obesity . The world , in general , has the opposite problem , I think . Models are never going to be average , they 're models . And so , that alone , they 're going to be thinner and taller and younger than the average American woman , but I still think they should be representatives of health . There 's been a lot of talk about exactly who is responsible for the models . And most of the people in the industry I talked to said they believe the agencies , and at a more basic level , parents are responsible . Some of the agents I spoke with say they are being pro active , and that when they do see a model who looks sick , they tell her she ca n't work , and get her to a doctor . Now , one magazine editor I spoke with , Soledad , said we happen to be in a skinny model moment . It 's unfortunate , but she said just like the fashions you see on the runway , this is a fad . And , of course , everyone hopes it will go away . Sounds like a lot of finger-pointing . Well , the agents are responsible . No, the parents are responsible . No, the models themselves are responsible . No, it 's the designers . That 's right . They play the blame game a little bit , yes . If they did n't put -- I mean , if everybody is skinny , then the girls have to be skinny to work . If they sort of picked heavier girls --
BC	The fight over the Senate Iraq resolution took another turn late last night . The senators behind it are now saying until their resolution gets a fair debate , they 're going to stop all other legislation from moving forward . Senator John Warner , in his letter to Senate leaders , wrote that Iraq is the , quote , "most pressing issue of our time . " And that he 's going to do everything in his power to , quote , "ensure a full and open debate . " Warner 's resolution says the Senate disagrees with the president 's plan to increase the number of troops in Iraq . NBC 's Tim Russert was on the stand for the prosecution in the perjury trial of Lewis " Scooter " Libby . He 's had the most dramatic testimony so far . Russert testified he did n't tell Libby about the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame , which is what Libby has claimed . Grand jury tapes also have Libby saying he first heard of Plame 's identity from Vice President Dick Cheney , his former boss . Tim Russert is back on the stand today . Lisa Nowak , that astronaut in big trouble for allegedly trying to kidnap a romantic rival , might not face attempted murder charges after all . That 's according to the " Orlando Sentinel " this morning . Prosecutors have decided -- not decided , rather , whether to proceed with that charge . It 's reportedly a decision that could take the state 's attorneys office weeks to decide . For the first time ever , you 're going to be able to buy an FDA- approved weight loss drug , and you 're not going to need a prescription . It 's just been approved . It 's called Alli , and it 's a lower dose version of the prescription diet drug Xenical . It works by blocking fat . There can be some very nasty gastrointestinal side effects , and there have been critics who say it raises the colon cancer risk , too -- Miles . M. O'BRIE Let 's turn now to the deadly winter weather . At least 16 have died in the elements and on the slippery roads so far , the weather causing accidents from Ohio into the mid-Atlantic and beyond . And more snow is coming . Eight feet could pile up by Sunday . Keep shoveling there . Keep shoveling . More than six feet is already on the ground right now in some areas . Let 's go right now to CNN 's Rob Marciano , who 's in Oswego , New York . There 's somebody else out there . But it 's a snowplow . Other than the snowplows , is anybody else out , Rob , this morning ? Well , good morning , Miles . You know , folks who live in upstate New York , they 're a hearty bunch . And especially in the lake effect snow country , Oswego and Oswego County line ( ph ) , they get glorified bobcats out here to grade up the snow and plow the snow . And then they get regular old snowplows out here as well . So there are people out and about . And they do a pretty good job of keeping the roads clear . The problem is it 's snowing so hard , when you 've got snowfall rates at two , three , four , five inches an hour , you know , you can never possibly clear that much snow .
BC	What is the Bahaman law regarding the paternity issue ? If the father` s name is written to birth certificate , does that make him the daddy ? My client` s the presumed father . But you know , as well as I do , presumption can be rebutted , and there` s a way to rebut it , just like you do in California . And all Mr. Birkhead has to do is get on a plane and , you know , go to Bahamas . Go to paradise and deal with it . We`ve been -- the court told him that months ago . Speaking of DNA testing , paternity testing , very quickly , back to Joshua Perper . He` s had an extremely long day , the autopsy itself taking over six hours , with an entire team . Dr. Perper , again , thank you for being with us . A lot of us criminal lawyers have admired you for many , many years . Dr. Perper , again , I just want to ask you , because I was not clear on your answer , regarding the security , for instance , typically , autopsy photos are taken . Were autopsy photos taken in the Anna Nicole Smith autopsy ? As part and parcel of the autopsy procedure , photographs of the body , of the tissue , and of the injuries are taken in order to document findings . Those photographs are under lock and key , and they are released only if there` s a court order or to the close family , which has the legal right to do so . And let me just mention , incidentally , because there was this question of , who is the true father , that this is not going to be a problem , because during the autopsy , we took samples which are going to permit to -- are going to help in any type of determination of the identity of the child from the end of the mother . And there are going to be additional testing of the child and of the individual who claimed that they are the father . So that` s going to be an issue which is going to be very easily resolved from a biological point of view . But , obviously , the legal matters are more complicated . And many viewers have been calling in and e-mailing in . Why do you need Anna Nicole Smith` s tissue for the baby` s DNA ? And the theory behind that is you do n` t want to bait and switch in court , in other words , for some other child` s DNA to be provided , you want to be able to check Dannielynn` s DNA against Anna Nicole Smith` s DNA to make sure you`re getting the real baby` s oral swab . That` s what that` s all about . Let me clear that up . And very quickly , Dr. Perper , before you leave us , where is her body now ? Is it there in the medical examiner` s office ? Yes . The body is in the medical examiner` s office . And because we had concern of the safety of the body , the one which you mentioned , we asked Sheriff Jenne , which is the sheriff of Broward County , to help us and provide sheriff` s protection , deputy sheriff` s protection . And he was very kind and very cooperative . And we have a number of sheriff` s deputies who are actually protect both the front and back of the office .
BC	One of the people who 's a very strong supporter of his is Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , who had to say this in the " Washington Post , " quote , " I 've been selling Petraeus to anybody who would listen . He 's the General Grant of the surge . He 's our last best chance as a military commander to bring about a change on the ground . " Spider , is he going to be able to get the job done and is he the last chance ? This is n't about Dave Piraeus . This is about trying to make a difference on the ground , making sure the soldiers and Marines on the ground , all the service members have what they need . Certainly you ca n't have an army or a service of lambs being led by a lion exclusively , but you prefer to have that . You prefer to have a great guy in charge . So Dave Petraeus is the right guy . He 's studied it , he 's fought in it . He knows what he 's talking about . We 've got to give him the opportunity . But let 's not call it a surge . General Shepard , you sent me an article earlier this week pointing that General Petraeus has surrounded himself with Ph.D.s , very bright people who also have a wealth of combat experience . What sort of advantage do you think that might give him in the field ? Well , it 's taking smart people that have been there and you 're looking for ideas . Dave Petraeus is the right guy at the right time over there . He has been there . He has studied it . He 's helped train the Iraqi military . This is a guy that knows what he 's doing , but he is on the hot seat . He will be held responsible for what happens over there and he 's got smart guys helping him to think through the thing , because this is not just a military problem , it 's a complex diplomatic political problem , as well . General Grange , I wanted to throw this at you . It 's a report that came out on Friday from the Council on Foreign Relations , a fellow named Steve Simon , writing about the Iraq war , making the case that the U.S. should pull troops out by 2008 , saying that " The crisis has now moved beyond the capacity of Washington to control on its own . The United States lacks the military resources and the domestic and international political support to master the situation . " He 's suggesting that the situation in Iraq may be irretrievable , regardless of how this troop increase goes , that the U.S. has got to think about getting out as soon as possible . I 'm sure that 's a course of action on the table . I always believe that there 's a way to accomplish a mission . I do n't think it 's hopeless . I think it 's very tough . The international community has already lost their will . It 's a good chance that the United States of America will lose -- we 'll lose our will , as well , and when that happens , no matter what you do , you will not be successful . Well , there 's a lot of people who have a lot of faith in David Petraeus and a lot of people hoping that he can make a difference on the ground .
BC	So this is not happening in a vacuum . And if it needs to be finessed at higher levels , that would n't surprise me in the least . David might well indeed be on to something . Yes , a one-sided proxy war , though , Michael , because the U.S. is its own proxy there in Baghdad . David Gergen , why do you think that the administration is talking so much about Iran these days ? Is it trying to find a boogeyman for all of the problems in Iraq ? Or could this really be leading to another development here in the war ? Well , there are ominous signs that we 're stepping up the pressure and that they 're stepping up the pressure simultaneously . You know , " Newsweek " has reported this week , John , as you know , that the United States is preparing to send a third carrier into the Persian Gulf region , to follow the second one , the president announced only a few weeks ago . So there is clear indications that both sides are ratcheting it up , that we could stumble into a confrontation , that one side may wish to prod the other one and goad it into some sort of action that will allow them to retaliate . You know , I have no doubt that the United States government , the military , as well as the White House , feel that Iran is meddling too much and that they -- Iran is a real problem . And there are a couple of explanations for that . One is Iran would like to have the United States fail in Iraq . The other thing is they 'd like to keep -- they 'd like to remind the United States , if you have hit us , if you have go after regime change in Iran , we can really cause you deep problems in Iraq . Do n't mess with us . Yes . And as some people have pointed out to me , David , in the last few days , that the more ships you throw in there to the Gulf , the greater you have increase the chances that some sort of action could happen ... Absolutely . ... that could trigger a very fast escalation . David Gergen in Boston and Michael Ware in Baghdad , thanks . Up next on 360 , back to Anderson on the edge of the Amazon rainforest with Jeff Corwin from " Animal Planet , " and a surprise or two , which may mean that Jeff has caught himself an alligator . Plus , a fateful call . His former top aide is on trial for perjury . But Vice President Cheney wo n't take the stand . So which one of the president 's men will take the fall ? And Anna Nicole 's final moments . She 's not breathing and she 's not responsive . She 's actually Anna Nicole Smith . The dramatic 911 call , ahead on 360 . Hey , welcome back . We are coming to you from the edge of the Amazon in central Brazil . I 'm here with Wildlife Biologist Jeff Corwin , who literally has been wandering around in the forest for the last 20 or so minutes . You 're covered in ants . And mud . COOPE What did you find ? I 've completed my own vision quest . I have had this awesome odyssey . But what I 'm about to show you just beautifully illustrates the biodiversity of this ecosystem .
BC	Girls are more likely to use prescription drugs , but both girls and boys report it 's really easy to acquire them at home , from their grandparents , in school or online . When you look at first - time drug users , almost as many kids now first try medicines to get high as marijuana . And the drugs are -- John Walters was there today . He said on prescription drugs , Lou , we are the dealers . Parents , teachers , we are the dealers , because it 's happening in our homes and in our schools . And I hope that Mr. Walters , our drug czar , would also acknowledge that this nation , we 're a nation of enablers . Until we win this war on drugs and deal with the addiction of so many millions of people , we 're going to be in very serious trouble . Truly a national crisis . Christine , thank you very much . Christine Romans . Time now for a look at some of your thoughts . Carolyn in Alabama said , " Since Bank of America wants to tap the illegals as a new business core , maybe they should issue their first card to the illegal drug smuggler who put Ramos and Compean in prison . " And Pat in California , " Lou , do you really think there is a war on drugs ? Look at Ramos and Compean in prison for trying to stop an illegal alien drug smuggler . " And Joan in Michigan , " I might have voted for the Democrats in 2006 , but considering none of them will stand up for Mr. Ramos and Mr. Compean , I will be voting Republican in 2008 ." Send us your thoughts at loudobbs.com . We 'll have more of your thoughts here later . Each of you whose e-mail is read receives a copy of my book , " War on the Middle Class . " Up next , shocking new revelations in the case against those two Border Patrol agents . You may find this latest twist difficult to believe . We did . We 'll have the special report . And then millions of middle-class jobs have been outsourced to cheap labor around the world , and in China particularly . Now Democrats on Capitol Hill say they 're ready to change all of that . And snow , sleet and high winds , a deadly winter storm slamming much of the nation . We 'll have the very latest for you , including a forecast . Stay with us for all of that and more . A leading Democrat has joined Republicans in demanding a wider investigation into the case of two imprisoned Border Patrol agents . The call by California Senator Dianne Feinstein comes one day after the release of explosive transcripts from the trial of Ramos and Compean . Those transcripts reveal more about the Mexican drug smuggler who received immunity from the prosecutor for testifying against the law enforcement agents . Casey Wian has the latest for us -- Casey . Well , Lou , it 's clear from the Ramos-Compean trial transcripts that prosecutors , defense attorneys , and the judge all believed that Mexican illegal alien Oscar Aldrete- Davila was involved in smuggling a second load of marijuana into the United States eight months after he was shot and wounded by the Border Patrol agents . The jury did hear limited details about the first drug load he was transporting in February 2005 , day he escaped from Ramos , Compean and several other agents . But the judge refused to allow the jury to hear that after prosecutors granted the smuggler immunity , he was tied to a second big marijuana load found at a stash house in Texas .
BC	Coming up , like a good neighbor ? Well , if you live in Mississippi , State Farm is not necessarily there . And FedEx delivers . They deliver a horrifying sight near Cincinnati . Somehow everyone walked away . We 'll tell you how . And what could be a new and better way to stop your kids from getting the flu and , more important for the kids , at least , take the sting out of the visit to the doctor . We 'll have that on AMERICAN MORNING. The most news in the morning right here . A little while ago we asked you the question , who 's got the grosser desk , the dirtier desk ? Do n't wrinkle your cute nose , Stephanie . Who 's got the dirtier desk ? We assume it 's the guys . We assume it 's the guys , right ? It 's just a question -- the men or the women ? Actually , a new study says women . Yes , I would have said that . Three to four times ... Really ? Why ? ... the amount of bacteria in and around their desks because women tend to store food . Oh . Like little squirrels you are , storing your food for the winter . One researcher said , " I was surprised how much food there is in women 's desks . If there 's ever a famine , that 's the place I 'm going to search for food . " Also because you have makeup and hand cream . All those things are like little petri dishes for germs . Interesting . Sorry ... Hi , Miles . Hi how are you ? Thanks , Soledad , for sharing ... How are you ? Just great . Feeling better all the time . Stephanie Elam is here . And we are talking about ice cream . We all scream for ice cream . My hands are clean because we 're talking about food . No, I do n't want anyone grossed out . And if anyone knows me , they know I 'm a freak about germs . But let 's talk about something heating up in the ice cream world . And it 's mergers . What 's going on here ? There is a New York investment firm that supposedly is interested in buying Marble Slab Creamy and Maggie Moos . This is according to " The New York Times . " Those are the second and third largest high-end ice cream chains in the U.S. So if they came together , they would take over the number one spot held right now by Cold Stone Creamery . And if you know how these guys work , you take your M&Ms, and you take your little things ... Oh , it 's so good . ... and they sit there and they just scoop it back and forth and mix it all in . It 's very yummy . So good . If you 're going to bring business reporting , you must bring samples for these types of segments , right ? Yes . We had a conversation and we knew -- and we knew you were not going to be happy about this . Without the food , man . This early in the morning . OK . Another thing I have to tell you about . Goats milk ice cream is apparently -- they 're still laughing at me -- goats milk ice cream is apparently becoming kind of a favorite among ice cream connoisseurs .
BC	Well , if you own or are in the market to own a home , we have some answers for you . Two words , actually . One is Zillow and the other is Zestimate . Zillo.com is a relatively new Web site that 's trying to do for real estate what Expedia did for travel . In fact , the same men are behind both Web sites . And what they 've done , they 've developed a new way to find your home 's value . They use public data to figure it out . Now , here is the Web site here . It 's going to be a new thing , a cool thing . We 're going to check out a home actually here in Seattle . You can type in any address and you get a Zestimate of what the house is worth . Now , this thing , they have got some kinks in it right now . Not sure how it 's going to work out . But , for example , we 've got this house here in Seattle . It 's in the $ 3.4 million range , like in the Betty Nguyen range , you know ? But actually , on zillow.com , you see the info and some other information and you find the zestimate . They say it 's actually worth about $ 1.1 million . So some kinks to work out . Why the huge discrepancies ? We 're going to be talking about that . You can also check out , I do n't know , your ex-wife 's house , maybe the house she took from you , see what it 's worth these days . T.J. Or you can check out celebrities homes as well . Brad -- and I think we 've got Brad and Angelina 's home in here somewhere . But you can check out celebrity houses and see what they 're worth as well . But Zillow is creating a lot of buzz right now . It 's on the cover of this week 's " Fortune " magazine . And tomorrow we will talk with the creators of Zillow about why they think their Web site will level the playing field between buyers and sellers . Yes . You may want to stay away from that ex-wife 's house , just to stay out of a little bit of trouble . But also coming up this weekend , I 'm going to speak with a remarkable teenager about his mission to end modern-day slavery . And learn how to get a financial life from author and actor , also former White House insider , Ben Stein . So , as always , very busy weekend here . We do n't have a choice but to not miss it . We hope you wo n't miss it either . So please , join us tomorrow morning at 7:00 Eastern . Be there , Miles . We zestimate it will be excellent . Thank you very much , guys . We 'll see you . It 's the video everyone 's talking about . We showed it to you right here on CNN. A tandem semi-truck trailer crashing into a police cruiser , captured on the cruiser 's dashboard cam . Everyone walked away from this . Everyone walked away . And we 're still amazed by what some of them told us a few moments ago . I had seen the police officer 's car on the left-hand side , and as soon as I had seen it , I tried to get over in the other lane to pass up the police cruiser . I pressed on my brake , and I lost control of my car .
BC	Trial transcripts reveal there was plenty of evidence that Aldrete Davala in fact had been transporting marijuana that day and again several months later . The transcripts have actually weakened the government 's case . It shows the behind the scenes maneuverings of the Justice Department . It shows that the Justice Department clearly knew that Aldrete Davala was not just a small time drug dealer but a big time cartel member who smuggled numerous times . Aldrete Davala admitted to another Border Patrol agent , a friend of the family , that he was smuggling a load of dope the day he was shot . That admission came several days before prosecutors gave Aldrete Davala immunity . Also a Homeland Security Department investigator testified at the trial that the smuggler violated the terms of his immunity agreement and the transcripts show prosecutors knew Aldrete Davala was connected to a second drug smuggling attempt . They had him in custody . He was in a federal courtroom . It would have been a very simple matter to have one of the U.S. marshals put the cuffs on him and lead him out , charge him with those offenses . And they failed to do that . In fact , prosecutors worked diligently to keep the jury from hearing anything about Aldrete Davala 's drug smuggling history . If someone has some evidence that Aldrete has committed a crime , I would love to have it and we would be happy to prosecute . To this day , the government continues to target the agents , not the smuggler . A spokesman for former agent Compean 's family tells us the Justice Department is now opposing a motion to release the agents on bond pending their appeal . That is significant , Lou , because just several weeks ago , the Justice Department was taking no position on efforts by the agents to stay out of prison pending their appeal . Lou ? And any indication why their change of position ? No indication from the attorneys representing the agents . It seems to me they may be digging in their heels because of all the criticism that they 've been receiving now that these transcripts are out there , Lou . Well , these transcripts , I mean , it took almost a year to get these transcripts of this trial . Any explanation as to the reason for such an inexcusable delay ? The simple explanation is that the transcripts were not requested until after the verdict was handed down and after the agents were sentenced . So it 's a small , relatively small court in El Paso . They say the person who does the transcripts is simply overwhelmed and that that person met the deadline imposed upon him by the appeals court . So we have a situation now where it appears that both the U.S. attorney lied about the time reference for granting limited use immunity , is that correct , Casey ? That appears to be correct , Lou , according to the documents , the evidence introduced in the case , absolutely . And it appears that the inspector general in homeland security lied to the United States Congress about is the background for this whole case and as to where it started . And to be what these agents had admitted to .
BC	Good morning , John and Soledad . It 's definitely something we 've talked about a lot . What 's going on with Daimler , as far as their Chrysler unit ? Well , " The Wall Street Journal " is reporting that they 're looking at perhaps spinning off their Chrysler unit or perhaps selling it , saying they 've gotten interest about it from around the world . They want to help cut costs at Chrysler , and , also , expand their international markets there . Let 's move on and see what 's happening . GM has come out and actually said that they may be in preliminary talks . Actually , I should say that this is speculative at this point -- that they 're in preliminary talks to buy Chrysler . A straight takeover could be risky since both companies are in the midst of trying to get their businesses back in the black and get stronger there . But one last thing that we should note . Hyundai , did come out , and after a British report saying they were interested in buying this unit from DaimlerChrysler , they 're saying , nope . We already have too much on our hands at this point . We are not interested , and just do n't even think about us when it comes to that , Soledad . That 's not a good way to go . All right , thank you very much . Appreciate it , Stephanie . Well , in uniform he is Troop Commander Wales , to the rest of the world , of course , he 's Prince Harry , third in line to the throne , and now reportedly ready to ship out to Iraq . CNN 's Paula Hancocks is live right in front of Buckingham Palace for us this morning with some late word from London . Good morning , Paula . Hello , Soledad . Well , Prince Harry has always said he wants to be treated like one of the boys , that he is training for Iraq , he wants to be able to see active duty in Iraq . Of course , he is not one of the boys . He is a prince . He is third in line to the throne , and so the fact that he may be going to serve in Iraq is causing a security nightmare . This is Prince Harry , aged eight , inspecting the troops with his mother , the late Princess Diana and clearly enjoying playing soldier . And 14 years later , Troop Leader Wales , third in line to the British throne , has trained for service in Iraq , and it looks as though he may be going . Military sources tell CNN that at this moment Prince Harry is expected to head for active duty in Iraq in April or May , but that could still change . No public confirmation from military or royal officials . Incoming ! This footage shows what life in Basra can be like . These British soldiers taking cover from a mortar attack . Take cover ! And 101 British soldiers have been killed in action in Iraq since March 2003 . But Harry has long insisted he wants to see action to fulfill his role as an officer . Even reportedly threatening to resign if is he stop from deploying for security reasons . PRINCE HARRY , TROOP LEADER WALE
BC	It 's the same thing , though , as " American Idol . " You see them built up . You see them crash . You see dreams realized , and you see dreams destroyed . It 's the same thing . Here , we see Britney Spears . She has nothing . We want to see her succeed . Then she succeeds . Now you 're getting a little too big for your britches . Oh , really ? That 's real nice , Ms. Fancy Pants . Then , she ca n't control it , and we like to see that she is destroyed . Now the next step is , we like to see her go into rehab . Let 's talk about Hillary Clinton . Yes . Going to switch gears completely here . Mm-hmm . A recent poll says that 62 percent of women thought Hillary Clinton was strong for standing by her man , despite her husband 's infidelity . Let me ask you a question . Let me ask you a question . First of all , this -- to me , this story is not about politics . It 's not about left and right , not about the Clintons . It 's about us . It 's about right and wrong . But let me take it on politics here for a second . If this was a conservative , if this couple happened to be Mitt Romney and his wife , do you think , if he was a serial philanderer , and did exactly the same things that Bill Clinton did , do you really think the feminists and 62 percent of women in this country would stand up and say , that -- she 's going back to him ; oh , that 's strong ? I will tell you what . We would hear from the Mormon Church , if Mitt Romney did that . Absolutely , you would . But you would hear from the women and the feminists -- because this has been made left/right , not right/wrong , you would hear from them : Oh , look at the little Mormon wife , following her husband wherever he goes . How does this make you strong ? This , to me -- take the Clintons out of it -- makes me so angry at American women , because they do n't have self-respect enough to say , no woman should ever be treated that way . But , Glenn , I have got to tell you something . In my circle at , least , if I did something like that , if I stood by my man who was a philanderer , I would be looked at as pathetic in my group . Oh , my gosh . You -- let me tell you something . This is ... It would be : Kyra , get a break -- get a life . This is the other thing that this story sends to the American people : Guys , cheat all you want . According to this ... It 's OK . ... six out of her 10 friends are going to say : Go back . He 's cool . I mean , that 's nuts . That could lead us into a whole 'nother discussion . Yes . Let 's talk about men and how faithful they are . That 's why this story is clearly about politics and left and right , and not about right and wrong , because , if it happened in your life , if it happened in my life , I can tell you what my wife 's friends and family would say to her about me , if I had done that .

We`re also going to have this . You should join hands , join hands , because it` s only in this country that you can join hands . We should all join hands . Judging the judge . The judge in the Anna Nicole Smith hearing is full of quips and quirks . Some say his style rules . Others object . We`re going to take a closer look coming up . SHOWBIZ TONIGHT for Wednesday night is coming right back . Welcome back to SHOWBIZ TONIGHT` s continuing coverage of the Anna Nicole Smith courtroom saga . I` m A.J. Hammer . As we`ve been reporting , it was Anna Nicole Smith` s mother , Virgie Arthur , versus Howard K. Stern today in the battle for Anna Nicole Smith` s body . They were back on the stand with some explosive testimony , from Virgie` s tearful words about her daughter` s drug use , to Howard K. Stern admitting he has been financially supported by Anna Nicole Smith for years now . And late today , a dramatic confrontation . Joining me tonight is investigative journalist Jane Velez Mitchell . She is in Hollywood . Ashleigh Banfield , host of Court TV` s Hollywood Heat , is joining us from Court TV` s New York studios . Ladies , are you ready ? Never . Well , let` s get into this very dramatic moment that came late today . Larry Birkhead` s attorney , Debra Opri , finally , point blank , got to ask Howard K. Stern , straight out , are you the father of Dannielynne ? Let` s take a look at this shocking moment . Your honor , you need to hear this . He testified yesterday , under oath , that he was the natural father of Dannielynne , under the laws of the Bahamas . does not recognize a biological father , and the laws in this state list the natural father as the biological father . Mr. Stern , you can laugh at me all you want . Are you , or are you not the biological father of Dannielynne , under the laws of this state ? Well , that` s not what they are there for , but face to face she finally got to ask the question right to Howard K. Stern . Ashleigh , he did n` t answer , as we saw , but when are we finally going to get this baby thing settled ? Oh heavens , you know , probably not in this particular court , because the judge reigning himself in , even though he digresses to this issue a lot . He reigns himself in to deal with just this issue at hand , and that is who gets to decide where Anna Nicole Smith` s dead body will be buried .
BC	DR. IRWIN REDLENER , AUTHOR , " AMERICANS AT RISK" : The medical system in the United States , generally speaking , is not at all ready for a true mass casualty event , for a mega-disaster . First problem , where to put the ill or injured ? For economic reasons , the number of hospital beds has shrunk by more than 100,000 . And overcrowded emergency rooms turn patients away in normal circumstances . Second problem , supplies . To economize , most hospitals stock only a few days worth of equipment and medicines . If transportation is disrupted by a terrorist attack or natural catastrophe , they could run out quickly . Third problem , staffing . A chronic shortage of nurses , lab workers , EMTs and others , could become critical . In a flu pandemic , some studies show as much as 70 percent of medical personnel will not show up for work , leading some experts to conclude the system could collapse altogether . New York Presbyterian Hospital is trying to better prepare its staff and facility . But these are tough economic times for hospitals , and the federal government has given them a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year to prepare . Not giving particularly those areas like New York , which are so much under the gun , more in the way of help in terms of emergency preparedness is really outrageous . A few hundred thousand dollars ? We spent $ 1.5 million a year just for increased security . The federal government has stockpiled some pharmaceuticals and supplies , done planning , enlisted retired medical personnel to help in a crisis . But the man in charge of the effort says not everyone in government or in medicine understands what the country could be facing . DR. CRAIG VANDERWAGEN , HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES , ASSISTANT SECRETAR I think it 's difficult for people to imagine some of these scenarios . Unless you were in Indonesia after the tsunami where bulldozers were used to bury people , unless you have been to Darfur . Unless you have witnessed the Station Nightclub fire . Peter Ginaitt took the difficult lessons of that night and helped establish a new system which lets Rhode Island hospitals and first responders see in real-time where there are beds and specialized care . Different levels of respiratory protection . The state now has more equipment on hand for mass casualty events . It was the Station fire that moved Rhode Island to prepare . Will it take some similar tragedy to motivate those that have not ? Well , next on this special edition of 360 , Hurricane Katrina , were lessons learned or will history repeat itself ? There were warnings . Everybody said , it 's going to happen one day . Well , it happened . All along America 's coastlines , it could happen . We just have n't done the analysis to be able to determine if those levees will hold up . And the outcome could be catastrophic . Katrina on an even larger scale , when "Edge of Disaster " continues . We have to stop pretending that disasters are extremely rare and unforeseeable . Over the past hour we have been exploring America , the vulnerable . How gaps in our security have made us weak , put us in the crosshairs of hidden terrorists and nature 's fury .
BN	Of course , Barbara , the Bush administration has a little credibility problem with this , given the faulty intelligence in the run-up to the war in Iraq . How are they going to get around that ? Well , it 's very clear that that is one stumbling block at this point , especially at the State Department , where they are very aware that their , you know , claims of WMD in Iraq did n't prove to be true . What officials say is this time it is different . They already do have the evidence in hand . The only reason they would not make it public , they say , is if it compromised their intelligence-gathering capability , but they are convinced this time that they do have the evidence in hand -- Miles . Barbara Starr at the Pentagon , thank you very much . Race to the White House now . A year away before any primary voting , but they 're campaigning like there 's no tomorrow . Senator Hillary Clinton campaigning in Iowa , bashing President Bush on Iraq . Former New York mayor , Rudy Giuliani , still testing the presidential waters , speaking to the New Hampshire Republican party convention . We look toward the future . We have to reassert our -- the basic core principles of the Republican Party . We 've got to be -- you know , we 've got to be about being Republican strong , not Democrat light . When people tell me , you know , I do n't think America can really face up to its problems , deal with this new global environment , make the hard decisions , I say do n't you count us out . We may not have had good leadership the last six years , but we are still the best , most able , can-do country in the world . Former Senator John Edwards , also in the race , of course , and he will join us at 8:15 Eastern . Stay tuned for that -- Soledad . There was a prince in the city , and they rolled out the red carpet in Philadelphia and New York this weekend for Britain 's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla . Charles was here to accept an environmental award , but the trip , though , is raising some questions across the pond , as they say . AMERICAN MORNING 's Alina Cho has that story . Good morning . Hey , good morning , Soledad . They think he 's a hypocrite there , right ? Yes . Sort of getting mixed reviews , you might say . You know , Prince Charles and his wife , Camilla , charmed Americans this weekend , but some in Britain say by coming to the U.S. the so-called green prince is a hypocrite . Either way , there was plenty of pomp and circumstance this weekend . In fact , you might say fit for a royal . To ask you to come forward and to accept this award as the tenth anniversary global environmental citizen . Congratulations . Former Vice President Al Gore presented Prince Charles with a special honor for his efforts to protect the environment . I ca n't tell you how touched and grateful I am for all these extraordinary flattering words that are being said about me . I find it rather strange after all these years of being the end of a certain amount of abuse . And all I can say is fame at last , so it 's encouraging .
BN	Well , it has been a cockpit controversy for ages : able - bodied , clear-eyed , quick-witted airline pilots forced to retire at the age of 60 . Now , the FAA has been considering whether to let older pilots keep their wings a while longer . Today , we get a decision . Joining us from Washington with details , Brianna Keilar . Hi , Brianna . Hi there , Don . That age 60 rule has been the rule since 1959 , but , today , a proposal from the FAA to up that mandatory retirement age for commercial airline pilots to 65 . Now , there is a condition here . If one of the pilots in a cockpit is between 60 and 65 , the other pilot would have to be younger than 60 . Historically , people who have opposed increasing this mandatory retirement age have said they 're concerned that , as pilots get older , they could make mistakes , and that those mistakes could potentially be disastrous . But the FAA says new data refutes those concerns . And today , when the FAA head Marion Blakey announced this new proposal , she cited safety as her reasoning for this change . The fact of the matter is that there 's a heck of a lot of experience behind those captain 's stripes , and we should n't have to lose it as early as we do these days . I want our older pilots to be around to help younger pilots rising up through the ranks . A pilot can learn a lot by seeing how the experienced vet handles a situation they may have only seen in simulation . Critics of this rule change , some of them pilots ' unions , say this is n't just about safety , it 's also about the bottom line . And that is really the case on both sides of the debate . Younger pilots , pilots who may have been laid off , have traditionally supported this cap at age 60 because that creates more opportunities for them as the older pilots are aged out . But now there 's really a more vocal group . And this is those veteran pilots who , as some of these larger airlines have declared bankruptcy , have pretty much seen their pensions evaporate . So this would give them five more years of paychecks . There is a sign that some critics could be changing their tune . ALPA , which is the Airline Pilots ' Association -- it 's the largest union for pilots in the entire world -- has historically opposed this increase in the mandatory retirement age . Officially , that 's still their line . But union members did elect a president very recently . He took office this month who personally supports this increase in age . So , perhaps a sign there that they 're willing to follow the FAA 's lead on this -- Don . Yes , and it 's been kind of a thorny issue for them for years . Brianna , tell us how long will this take before it 's adopted ? It seems like this rule will take quite a while before it 's adopted . Today , Marion Blakey , head of the FAA , said she estimates it could be 18 months to two years or maybe even longer than that . It 's really sort of a long process that this would go through .
BN	What kind of effect did Reagan have when he came to visit ? Is this -- do you think this is more of a P.R. move , or does this really affect things economically , trading wise , investor wise ? I mean , what type of effect do you think this has truly outside of a P.R. move ? President Reagan was here in 1985 during trading hours . Kyra , he actually came again in '92 with Mikhail Gorbachev , but he came to talk about his economic policy . And he 's absolutely beloved on Wall Street , as you can imagine . And it 's almost stating the obvious that -- that this is his audience . This is a conservative crowd . This is the kind of community where less government intervention is something that is applauded . Lower taxes , that 's something that investors like . More trade policies , that 's something investors like . They want to see it translate to the bottom line . And , Kyra ... Are you close to him , Susan ? Is he coming toward you ? I do n't see him yet , but I see a lot of Secret Service people , and I 'm edging in , and I have my tiny wireless microphone , and I 'm going to extend it if I see him . Absolutely . As he makes -- and I 'll try to monitor this other shot that we have , Susan . If I can see that he 's making his way toward you , getting closer toward you , we 're expecting you to stick that mic out . You never know what he might say to you . I am definitely going to do it . And I 'm glad that I have two athletic brothers that trained me well for reporting from the floor of the stock exchange , Kyra . That is for sure . You 're going to do a body block for us to get yourself in there , and get a word with the president ? You know , it 's interesting . This is a very busy day , as I mentioned . We have the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates . We have a lot of corporations reporting their earnings today , like Boeing , for instance , very nice earnings . And the GDP -- it was a logical place for the president to come . The GDP , which is broadest measure of the economy , Kyra , came in much better than expected . The president really has some evidence to say that the U.S. economy is in good shape . I ca n't see him just yet , but I think he is close by , Kyra . I think he is making his way toward you , because I recognize some of the monitors and the lead Secret Service guy that 's right in front of him is -- he 's got a kind of a light blue tie . You 'll see about ... Actually ... Can you see him ? I see -- I see the -- yes , I do see him . I see his gray head . I 'm gutting pushed back , but I 'm ... What do you want to know from the president , Susan ? I would like to know what he thinks he can achieve with the majority -- with the Congress he can no longer count on to support him in terms of some of the policies he 's proposing .
BN	Man , Williams was in his second year with the Broncos . He was 24 years old . Have you noticed , 2007 is off to a frigid start . People are shivering from the desert to the High Plains . The big winter storm that blew in just ahead of the new year is blamed for at least a dozen deaths . Parts of Colorado got up to four feet of snow . After barreling across Colorado , the snow and the ice moved into the Plains . Nebraska , Kansas , Oklahoma all feeling the icy weather . The roads , due to the ice , causing a lot of accidents . Tens of thousands of people all across that region are without power . In New Mexico , a nightmare for holiday travelers . The storm dumped up to two feet of snow in Albuquerque , stranding hundreds of motorists . So , what a way to spend New Year 's Eve ? Stuck in your car on a snowbound highway . That 's how hundreds of motorists in New Mexico ushered in '07 . KOAT 's Sasha Androtte ( ph ) has the story from Albuquerque . It 's not much of a party , but this is where hundreds of people spent New Year 's Eve . Pretty frustrated , I ca n't get home , you know ? They are talking about free shelters , but I live here . Drivers determined to get out of Albuquerque before '07 opted to sit in traffic and wait . Well , we are trying to go back to Edgewood and kind of have a party tonight . You know , the rest of the family is back there . In this long line , everybody had a story . Chris Carpenter lives in the East Mountains , but he was at ( INAUDIBLE ) all day with his wife . She just got her gallbladder removed this morning . Now he 's trying to get home to take care of his dog . She 's probably cold and hungry . And Dawn Linganfalter ( ph ) is nine months pregnant . Well , I 'm already in position to have my baby anytime . So the doctor is expecting me to go into labor . As if that 's not enough weight to carry , she also has four fussy kids in the back seat . The baby is cranky . He wants to get out and go outside and play . But no matter how badly people wanted to get home -- Real bad . Why ? Because we do n't want to be stuck in the car all night . State police would n't budge . It 's all shut down . The icy roads and heavy fog made this a New Year 's Eve to remember , or maybe one people would rather forget . Chad Myers is in the CNN Weather Center . That 's record snow for Albuquerque , right ? The U.S. death toll in Iraq has reached 3,000 as the military marked that somber milestone , there 's this : For the first time , more U.S. troops disapprove of how President Bush is handling the Iraq war , than approve . That 's from a new " Military Times " poll ; 35 percent of service members polled say they approve , 42 percent disapprove . Only 41 percent of military members now say the U.S. should have gone to war in Iraq . That 's down from 65 percent in 2003 .
BN	Another journalist was kidnapped in Gaza today . He is 50-year- old Jaime Razuri , a Peruvian photographer with a French news agency , AFP. Arm militants abducted Razuri in Gaza City , just before sundown . This is the latest of string of kidnappings of journalists and aid workers in Gaza in recent months . Most have been released after a few hours . A Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman says a pilot who flew a small plane into the skies over President Bush 's Crawford , Texas ranch , did so accidentally . The plane wandered into the restricted air space at midday yesterday . And Air Force spokesman says NORAD scrambled F-16 fighter jets . The jets got the pilot 's attention with flares . He landed , was interviewed , and then sent on his way . And Federal Aviation Officials are chalking up a UFO sighting to odd weather anomaly , but some United Airline workers beg to differ . A report in today 's " Chicago Tribune " quotes them as saying they are sure they saw a saucer-shape craft over O'Hare airport last fall . They say it had no lights , hovered , then shot off through the clouds . The FAA is not investigating , Wolf . We want to see those pictures , right , Mary ? Absolutely . Once we see the pictures , we will make up our own mind . Thanks very much for that . Coming up , now that a brutal former dictator is dead , might 2007 be less brutal for Iraq and Iraqis ? I will speak with " New York Times " reporter John Burns , Pulitzer Prize winner , about Iraq 's future after Saddam Hussein . John is in Baghdad . Meanwhile , now that Saddam Hussein is dead some of his supporters want revenge . They are calling for strikes against the United States , without mercy . We 'll be right back . To our viewers , you are in THE SITUATION ROOM , where new pictures ask information are arriving all the time . Happening now , Saddam Hussein 's final minutes . What really happened in the gallows as the former dictator about to be hanged ? We have new details about what was said , including taunting by guards and how Saddam Hussein responded . Also , Somalia 's government reclaims the capital . But will it be able to secure the peace ? And what happens when thousands of Ethiopian troops , backing them up , go home ? And the New Year promising to bring a new crop of presidential contenders . We are going to show you the roster for the next race for the White House . I 'm Wolf Blitzer . You are in THE SITUATION ROOM. All that coming up , but first , we want to go back to the United States capitol , the Rotunda , specifically , on Capitol Hill . There is Betty Ford the 88-year-old widow of the former President Gerald R. Ford . She 's returning to see the casket of her husband 's body lying in state . This is an emotional moment for Betty Ford . She will sit . She is an elderly woman . Clearly she was moved , and has been moved , throughout this ordeal . Wants to spend a few moments with the body , with the casket , just before she returns tomorrow morning to the National Cathedral , will be the scene for the final memorial service here in the nation 's capitol . Eventually the body will go to Grand Rapids , Michigan , for burial .
BN	In a short time , the gentleman from Grand Rapids proved that behind the affability was firm resolve . When a U.S. ship called the Mayaguez was seized by Cambodia , President Ford made the tough decision to send in the Marines , and all the crew members were rescued . He was criticized for signing the Helsinki Accords , yet history has shown that document helped bring down the Soviet Union as courageous men and women behind the Iron Curtain used it to demand their God-given liberties . Twice assassins attempted to take the life of this good and decent man , yet he refused to curtail his public appearances . And when he thought that the nation needed to put Watergate behind us , he made the tough and decent decision to pardon President Nixon , even though that decision probably cost him the presidential election . Gerald Ford assumed the presidency when the nation needed a leader of character and humility . And we found it in the man from Grand Rapids . President Ford 's time in office was brief , but history will long remember the courage and common sense that helped restore trust in the workings of our democracy . Laura and I had the honor of hosting the Ford family for Gerald Ford 's 90th birthday . It 's one of the highlights of our time in the White House . I will always cherish the memory the last time I saw him , this past year in California . He was still smiling , still counting himself lucky to have Betty at his side , and still displaying the optimism and generosity that made him one of America 's most beloved leaders . And so on behalf of a grateful nation , we bid farewell to our 38th president . We thank the almighty for Gerald Ford 's life , and we ask for God 's blessings on Gerald Ford and his family . The holy gospel of our lord , Jesus Christ , according to John . Jesus said do not let your hearts be troubled . Believe in God , believe also in me . In my father 's house there are many dwelling places , if it were not so , would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you ? And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and will take you to myself so that where I am , there you may be also . And you know the way to the place where I am going . Thomas said to him , Lord , we do not know where you are going , how can we know the way ? Jesus said to him , I am the way and the truth and the life . The Gospel of the Lord . ( INAUDIBLE ) CERTAI May the words of my mouth and meditations of my heart be always acceptable in my sight oh , Lord , my strength , and my redeemer . Jesus said many things and many of his words have been reflected in the life and ministry of Gerald Ford . In Matthew 5 at the beginning of our Lord 's ministry , Jesus gives us a list of virtues in the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount .

BN	Thank you . Bye-bye . And we 're waiting for a White House briefing to begin . CNN has just learned the president is expected to make a major speech on Iraq next Wednesday night . Our Suzanne Malveaux is attending that briefing . She 's going to join us live . We 're going to follow that briefing for you straight ahead from the NEWSROOM. Taxpayer dollars for lawmaker pensions is one thing . Taxpayer dollars for convicted lawmakers ' pensions is quite another . Will the new ethics-minded Congress do anything about it ? A live report . Drew Griffin with his investigation up next . Tornado warnings in southeast Georgia . The new Congress has hit the ground running . Lawmakers already have a plan to cut taxes . Susan Lisovicz joins us from the New York Stock Exchange to explain all of that . Hello , everyone , I 'm Kyra Phillips at the CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta . And I 'm Don Lemon . Pension shmension . Drew Griffin 's report about convicted lawmakers drawing government pensions sure got all of you fired up . Will the new ethics-minded Congress close the loophole ? You 're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. Live pictures of the White House there , Washington , D.C. Our Suzanne Malveaux in a briefing , being told that we are expecting the president to make that speech on Iraq , that new direction in Iraq on Wednesday . We are expecting to hear from White House representative Tony Snow at a briefing 4:00 p.m. Eastern time , we 're being told now , not at 3:00 Eastern time , but at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time . We 'll bring it to you live when it happens . Well , if you blinked , you missed it . Yesterday 's passage in the House of a tough new ethics measure outlawing gifts and trips from lobbyists . It was the first order of business for the 110th Congress , but many think ethics reform should go further . They want lawmakers convicted of felonies to lose their pensions . What timing you have . CNN investigative correspondent Drew Griffin has been following all of that for us . New information ? I hope it 's good . We have some new information coming up . But , you know , that ethics bill passes yesterday , big hoopla over it . There was not a mention , not one provision whatsoever that says a Congressman convicted of a felony would lose his pension . They still get it . RANDALL " DUKE" CUNNINGHAM , FORMER CONGRESSMA I broke the law . Convicted Congressman Randall " Duke " Cunningham is getting his $ 64,000 annual pension while sitting inside this federal prison . I 'd like to have a little bit of room . Convicted Congressman James Traficant , who snubbed his -- well , snubbed his fellow colleagues , is getting $ 40,000 while serving prison time as well . And they are not alone . The National Taxpayers Union says 20 lawmakers convicted of crimes over the last 25 years still got their pensions . And the NTU estimates about a million taxpayer dollars every year are going to the pensions of Congressional crooks . It 's hard , unless maybe you 're a member of Congress or a former member of Congress , for anybody to understand how on Earth you could ask taxpayers to pay pensions for people like that .
BN	So , how about the winds there ? There 's a blowing snow advisory in effect , we 're hearing that from our meteorologist that winds are being clocked at somewhere between , you know , 45 miles - per-hour and higher , in certain areas , would that impact conditions there at your ski resort ? Would that make for any kind of dangerous conditions that you need to look out for ? No, not in terms of dangerous conditions . We would certainly shut down any lift that would go into an exposed area where winds would be up to 45 miles-per-mile like they 're projecting . OK . All right . Darcy Morse , communication manager at Winter Park Resort , thanks so much . You 're welcome . So , once again , we 're continuing to watch the situation , just about 60 miles west of Denver on Highway 40 , massive avalanche is how it 's being described , because we 're talking about 100 to 200-feet wide of snow and 15 feet deep that has pushed its way onto this road . At least two vehicles were buried . They have been able to rescue at least seven people , many of them have been transported to nearby hospitals , but right now , many teams are on the ground to try to survey whether there are any other vehicles that are buried . Let 's hope not . Bonnie Schneider in the Weather Center , this blowing snow advisory still in effect ? Yes it is and it will continue straight through Sunday . And I want to talk be at dynamics of the wind and how that could cause an avalanche . Right now we have very strong winds and we 've had them for the morning , they actually picked up in intensity out of the west at 24 miles-per-hour . Now looking at the area , this is a Google Earth image and you can see the mountains , and here 's Berthoud Pass , kind of right in between there along the mountains . The winds are coming in from the west , so they 're blowing up what we call the windward side of the mountain , blowing up and up and up on that snowpack , and then the snow gets deposited on the leeward side . But what happens is when you have heavy snowfall and strong winds it fluctuates quite a bit because you can get a blast of wind coming down and that could force the snow down , from the highest peak all the way down here , as it comes down the mountains . So , strong winds and heavy snow come together to create avalanche danger as the winds in this situation are coming in from the west , coming down the mountain . And remember , that leeward side of the mountain is packed with heavy snow , two feet of snow from two weeks ago , combined with another half a foot in recent weeks . And then we still have blowing snow . Even right now , we could still see couple of inches of snow popping up into the region , kind of as it 's redistributed , in the terms of weight . And another factor to mention , as we 've been watching our temperatures , they really have not warmed up a lot , since the increase of snowfall , two weeks ago , so you do n't have a dramatic snow melt , but you do have that sunshine during the day that loosens the snow and melts the initial layer on the top and to some degree some bit below if as well . So that loosening also kind of shifts the weight about , that combined with the strong winds blowing in from the west . And we 're seeing those winds gusting as high as 24 miles-per-hour , right now , sustained . Gusts have been up to 30 and a couple of hours ago , they were up to 40 . So really , all these factors coming together really do create a dangerous situation right in the foothills , in this case right here in Colorado -- Fred .
BN	It kept showing up . Demand , perhaps ? Cicarelli , Cicarelli . Yes , you got it . OK , an alleged high class brothel bust to tell you about , this time in suburban Atlanta . Police say a former " Penthouse " centerfold was one of two women returning -- or running a call girl ring in a million dollar mansion . Residents had complained about scantily clad women , high traffic and loud parties . But the big break came when police were tipped off to a brazen Web site advertisement . The prosecutor says : " Dates could cost up to $ 10,000 . " The women , as you noticed there in that video just moments ago , right there , are out on bail . Those are the most popular , huh ? A brothel and some steamy pictures of a Brazilian model . Oh , but this is pretty popular . Check that out , huh ? This is -- this is strange , too . A lot of people are clicking on this video from suburban Atlanta . A wild boar was shot dead and hanging from the hunter 's front yard . Wow ! William Coursey says the hefty nine foot long hog weighed 1,100 pounds . Can you just imagine what that smells like right about now ? Ugh . Yes . You might want to take that out of your front yard . I bet your wife 's not too happy about that . But , Reynolds , that 's the bacon he wanted . He 's hungry . Yes , that 's the -- see , Reynolds , you talk about bacon ...

Mom and dad actually had to pull over on a major highway in Georgia because little Torey ( ph ) could n't wait to come into this world . We 'll introduce you to the family right here in our studio in about 24 minutes . Plus , we 'll stick with the theme of speed . Even if the presidential election is still two years away , it feels like many political household names already traveling at high speeds on the campaign highway . Our reality check with Josh Levs , coming up in about 10 minutes . For the first time in 12 years , Democrats take control of both houses of Congress . And Nancy Pelosi becomes the first female speaker of the House . At cnn.com , we 've profiled Speaker Pelosi and other women who have made milestones in U.S. politics . Nancy Pelosi is a representative for the 8th Congressional District of California , where she was reelected 10 times . As speaker of the House , Pelosi is second in the line of succession to the presidency , just after the vice president . As she takes up her new position , she vows to lead the most honest and open Congress in history . Other women have also made history in politics . In 1916 , Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives . In 1925 , Nellie Taylor Ross of Wyoming was the first woman governor . Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female Supreme Court justice in 1981 . And in 1984 , New York Democrat Geraldine Ferraro was the first female vice presidential running mate of Walter Mondale for the presidency .
BN	Jack Anderson has scored a final victory against the government . After the muckraking columnist died , the FBI touched off an uproar by trying to seize his private papers to look for classified documents . Anderson 's family fought back , and this week the FBI backed off . The reaction from Anderson 's son Kevin , " As my father would have said , when the media shines the light on the government 's wrongdoing , the cockroaches go scurrying for cover . " For weeks now , Michelle Malkin and other conservative bloggers have been hammering The Associated Press over the use of an Iraqi source for a story on the burning and shooting of six people during an attack on a Sunni mosque . The AP said the source was a police captain named Jamil Hussein . But both U.S. and Iraqi officials doubted the man 's existence , and critics questioned when the wire service had fabricated the source , and maybe even asked for a retraction . But this week , Iraq 's Interior Ministry said there is a police officer named Jamil Hussein and that he faces arrest for talking to the media without permission . AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll told "Editor and Publisher , " " I never quite understood why people chose to disbelieve us about this particular man on this particular story . " And some print journalism news this week . " TIME" magazine moved up to Friday publication , leaving the traditional Monday to " Newsweek " and " U.S. News , " in what managing editor Rick Stengel called an effort to help shape the media agenda . A midweek deadline is a gamble , though and this week " TIME" missed Nancy Pelosi 's swearing in as speaker . And " The Wall Street Journal " is sounding more like " TIME , " promising that 80 percent of its stories will now be analysis and interpretation , with more scoops broken on the Web. " The Journal " shrunk to a smaller size this week , and while the space for news looks cramped to me , the once great paper , with a hat tip to " USA Today , " is a lot more colorful . I 'm still having trouble getting used to how light it feels . Coming up in our second half hour , " The New York Times " on the pornography beat . Are newspapers covering a thriving business or selling smut ? Plus , presidents and the press , why Gerald Ford may have been the last chief executive to get along well with reporters . That 's all after a check of the hour 's top stories from the CNN Center in Atlanta . Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. The country said good-bye this week to Gerald Ford , as journalists continued to heap praise on the 38th president . In fact , those speaking at the National Cathedral memorial service were the current president , a former president , a former secretary of state , and NBC 's Tom Brokaw , who says Ford called him last year and asked him to deliver a eulogy . I think it is testimony to the relationship that he did have with the press corps . We were adversaries , not enemies . We challenged him , we were persistent , but he tolerated us . And he more than -- he understood what our role was .
BN	Geek heaven today in Las Vegas . The International Consumer Electronics Show opens this morning . There are a lot of cool gadgets to see and play with . CNN 's Renay San Miguel is there with a look at that . And gosh , we 've got another VHS-Betamax kind of thing going on right now . He 'll tell us about that . Good morning , Renay . Good morning , Miles . Yes , VHS versus Betamax 2.0. Microsoft and half of the industry supporting HD DVD for the next generation DVD technology , the other half of the industry , including Sony , supporting Blu-ray . And right smack in the middle is the consumer . So , I sat down with Gates for a one-on-one interview yesterday , talked to Bill Gates about this , and I asked a question about whether or not he felt bad for the consumer , who 's going to have to make a very expensive choice here . And he kind of gave me a standard answer , so I tried to dig in deeper with a follow-up . Here 's how that part of the conversation went . ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) If you had your way , you would be putting everybody into the same room and saying , can we please come up with something that would make the consumer not have to make that choice ? If you had the way ... That 's right . No, that 's absolutely right . It 's too bad , but , you know , HD DVD has a lot of great things going for it . And , you know , I 'm sure that there may be some technology things that can happen . But for now , you know , I think we 've got a lot of happy users , and that number will just go up . That 's what everybody in the industry is hoping . Now , Gates is really here to talk about the next generation of his Windows operating system , Vista , which comes out at the end of this month . One of the products that will be supporting Vista is this HP touch-smart PC . Very interactive here -- you just touch and you can manage all your media , your movies , your music , your -- your digital photos , as well as get on the Internet . All of it touch screen . One of the products that 's supported here . Jim Barry with the Consumer Electronics Association joins us now to talk about some of the other products . And -- and he talked about technology maybe coming to the rescue in this HD DVD battle . Here 's an example . You 're right , Renay . Nice to see you again . This is the LG Super Multi Blue player . This will play both Blu- ray and HD DVD disks . So this will play both of them , solve that consumer 's dilemma . This is going to be about $ 1,200 , available in the second quarter . Yes . Remember those first VCRs cost that much 30 years ago . I know . It 's still an expensive solution , but a solution nonetheless . Exactly . Speaking of HD , this new from Panasonic , a high-definition camcorder , that it will record either on these little DVDs to about 40 minutes of HD on one of those , or on those little postage stamp-sized SD cards .

Kraft got involved with Braun in the Tassimo market . There are a lot of these different machines . The idea is Braun makes these machines , Kraft sells the coffee in these little pods . You have to make some commitment before you buy one of these machines , because once you buy them , you 're stuck buying the coffee of the coffee maker . It is n't working out so well for Kraft . The company is writing off $ 245 million , its commitment to this thing , and says it 's going to scale back on the production of this . So people are n't buying this . You know , I do n't know if people are buying -- are n't buying all of them . It 's expensive . Yes . It 's useful if you 're one person and you 're making coffee and no one else drinks coffee . You do n't want to waste a pot . But it 's -- you really have to be pretty committed to it . So that is the story with Kraft . We 'll see what happens .

He 'll announce the plan on national TV tomorrow night . He 's meeting today with Republicans and Democrats , both sides of the aisle , voicing concern about sending more troops to Iraq .
BN	But U.S. officials have been careful to say that they do n't know that 's the case . They have not been able to confirm that yet . And , so , they are not saying . And , of course , they 're looking for more than just those three people . They believe that there are many al Qaeda operatives , including some fairly high-level , including the ones you mentioned . All right , Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon with new information -- thank you , Jamie .

What can you say about that guy ? That poor , pathetic man . Yes ! Yes , that 's Barbara and Rosie on " The View " this morning responding to an open letter to Rosie released by Trump yesterday . In that letter , Trump detailed , one more time , his allegations that Barbara Walters does n't like Rosie , does n't want her on " The View . " Well , this show of unity this morning also comes after reports of a rift between the two " View " co-hosts over how Barbara has responded to Trump in the past . Both Barbara and Rosie said that they are moving on . Hopefully , this time , they mean it . But , Trump , of course , has already responded to today 's show with a statement , calling Walters a liar , and saying , " Barbara has become a figurehead dominated by a third-rate comedian . " However , Don , I believe their conviction this morning , when they said , " We 're moving on , " I believe , by that , they actually did mean it . Oh , well , we will see . Oh , I 'm getting an e-mail from Donald Trump here and Barbara . " Thanks for the publicity , " they said . Yes . LEMO Yes . Yes . Yes , right . All right , well , let 's move on from this .

On this morning after the big speech , the big push on Capitol Hill . Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and defense chief Robert Gates appearing before lawmakers . The reception from the Democratic-controlled Congress less than enthusiastic , some would say . CNN Congressional correspondent Andrea Koppel joining us now -- so , Andrea , some of these Democrats now happy with the plan . But just how much real resistance can they offer to its execution ? Well , Heidi , you know , depending upon what they choose to do , quite a bit . At one end of the spectrum , there 's always the power of the purse . They could cut off funds for the war , something that Democrats say they 've taken off the table for the existing troops in Iraq . But they could do so for future troops . Then you could also have what Senate Democrats are considering doing next week , and we expect them to do so , which is to introduce a resolution which would be mostly symbolic , but would criticize President Bush and show Congressional opposition to his decision to move more troops in . And then you could have what 's happening today and tomorrow , and that is , you have Senate hearings and House hearings . And , in fact , one of those who is going to be leading the hearing next -- tomorrow in the Senate Armed Services , Carl Levin , spoke to CNN a short time ago , and he said rather than boosting the number of troops in Iraq , we should be drawing them down . The present course is a disastrous course , getting in deeper is a greater disastrous course . Everybody wants to succeed in Iraq , obviously . The president 's course is not the road to success . You also have public statements that Congressional leaders can issue . Yesterday , following the president 's speech , there was a joint statements from Democrat leaders in the House and the Senate in which they said we will demand answers to the tough questions that have not been asked or answered to date . The American people want a change of course in Iraq . We intend to keep pressuring President Bush to prove it . Now , Heidi , even though they 're united in opposition to President Bush , there is still a lot of debate behind the scenes as to exactly what they should do next .
BN	Cutting your cancer risk -- things you can do right now to stay healthy . That story coming up in THE NEWSROOM. Fighting a killer -- one of the nation 's most well known cancer survivors issues a challenge in the battle against cancer . Now is not the time to stall when it comes to funding . Now is not the time to stall when it comes to attention . Lance Armstrong speaks out , ahead in THE NEWSROOM. Are they the next hot Hollywood couple ? David Beckham and his wife coming to America . Oh , yes , he 's playing soccer , too . The whole story , we 'll get you the whole story , in THE NEWSROOM. There is a good chance you know someone who 's fighting cancer . The American Cancer Society estimates more than a half million people died from cancer-related causes last year . But cancer is no longer a death sentence . There have been tremendous strides in treating the disease . But in a cnn.com column , cancer survivor and cycling great Lance Armstrong says there 's still work to be done . Armstrong talked about the battle earlier on CNN 's " AMERICAN MORNING . " Tell us about this column you wrote on cnn.com . It really touched a nerve , what you said in it . And , first of all , give people the gist of what you wrote . Well , it was interesting , just when we start to think that Americans do n't really care about the fight against cancer or are perhaps distracted with other issues in the country , we post a column like that and lo and behold , it 's one of the most viewed sites ever on cnn.com . So , it 's refreshing to know that we truly care . The basis of the story was just a general impatience that I have , and a whole army of people have , with the way we 're going about things , the with lack of funding , with the lack of attention and the lack of focus and the lack of -- ultimately , the lack of leadership . Well , let 's talk about this lack of funding and lack of leadership . How much of the problem right now , when you look at trying to find a cure for cancer , is a lack of money and how much of it is just perhaps science reaching its outer boundaries ? Well , you know , before we paint a dark picture , I should say that we , you know , we 've made tremendous progress . I mean I would n't be sitting here today if we had not made progress . There 's 10 million cancer survivors in this country , so obviously they feel like we 've made progress . But the point is that now is not the time to stall when it comes to funding . Now is not the time to stall when it comes to attention . I mean I think it 's an interesting time scientifically . And there are two things that you always need with any great team is leadership and young potential . And , you know , coming along right now with the stalling that we 're seeing , you 're going to lose both of those things . So our focus and our objective now , and the millions of people that we have behind us , are to make it an issue again , especially going into the tees .
BN	Well , it 's pretty clear that there are contending American and Iraqi agendas here . The United States is looking for a road home , which requires at least a minimal fulfillment of American objectives here . To accomplish that , they 've got to have some kind of healing process amongst Iraqi politicians of different ethnic and religious backgrounds . Mr. Maliki , on the other hand , is a tribute of Shiite religious interest and as he would see it , of the 60 percent of the population that are Shiites who have waited a thousand years for this opportunity to rule here and they do not intend to be deflected or , if you will , constrained by the United States . So I think what we 're going to see here is a growing contest of wills . And I would n't be at all surprised if the loser in that is Mr. Maliki . There 's much talk across the river in the Green Zone about easing him out over the next few weeks or months . So in other words , Nouri al Maliki could be in trouble unless he delivers . Bottom line , do you think he has the guts to go stand up against Muqtada al Sadr and the Mahdi Army , this Shiite militia in Sadr City ? You know , I do n't think it 's a question of guts , I think all these people who went through the fire with Saddam , they 're all former exiles , as you know . All of them , Mr. Maliki included , lost large proportions of their family to Mr. Saddam Hussein 's gulag . I think it 's a question of will and whether or not Maliki -- Nouri al Maliki can break with 30 or 40 years of commitment in the Shiite religious cause . There 's no sign to date that he 's been prepared to do that . He makes the right speeches . He sat across the table from President Bush and said all the right things . He did right from the start when he took office eight months ago . He just has n't done it . He continues to look for ways around it . Indeed , at the extreme , he has intervened to persuade the Americans to release captured Iraqis who the American military command has designated as death squad leaders in the Shiite interest . So the signs are not good . And I think one interpretation you can make of the Bush plan is they 've built in assumption in , that Maliki will not fulfill those pledges . He wo n't meet the bench marks . And the Americans have been working intensively behind the scenes to create a kind of parallel political movement , a moderate political movement , based on factions within the existing Iraqi parliament that could be used as a vehicle for a parliamentary coup against Mr. Maliki . Fascinating material . One related question , this U.S. military operation in the northern part of the country in the Kurdish area against these Iranian officials , supposedly diplomats , it 's causing some heartburn in the Iraqi government among the Kurds . What 's going on ? Well , I 'm in Baghdad . It happened in Irbil 150 miles north of here . But it seems to me from everything I know about it that it 's the straw in the wind . Whatever else it may mean , and clearly the Iranians have been up to no good here . They 've been supplying sophisticated weapons , including armor penetrating missiles and rockets to insurgents here . They 've been helping to kill American soldiers .
BN	You have a very weak transitional federal government , you have Ethiopian troops there who are highly resented . So I think the U.S. effort now is going to focus first on trying to get some other African peacekeepers in there so that the Ethiopians can withdraw , and then to see whether this transitional federal government can really create a broad- based government . If it cannot , we 're going to see a lot more turmoil in that region , and we will inevitably be involved . What can - what should Somalis be able to expect of Washington ? I think in the first instance , the U.S. will try very hard and put up some of the money , although not enough is yet available , to get a substitute peacekeeping force in , so they - Somali people do n't just turn entirely against the Ethiopians , and you have a kind of insurgency there against the Ethiopians . Then , I hope the United States will work with the African neighbors and other neighbors to Somalia to help this transitional federal government really reach out and bring in more elements of Somali society into a government . And then , of course , there will need to be humanitarian and economic assistance . It 's going to be a very big task , but I think now , unlike the last 12 years , we ca n't just walk away from Somalia and just assume that the chaos there does n't affect us . Princeton Lyman with the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations , speaking to us earlier . Now , when we come back - how pervasive are the ( inaudible ) of terror in this volatile region of the Muslim world ? We shift our focus to the core of U.S. and international concern - the terrorists themselves . Stay with us . That area is a safe haven of international terrorists . So we 're all cooperating in order to find out there whereabouts , and sometimes if they 're not coming over ( inaudible ) , we have to eliminate them . The Horn of Africa has been considered a major source of global terrorism by the United States for the better part of a decade . The region became a suspected terrorist hotspot in the 1990s , when Sudan , then ruled by the National Islamic Front , provided a haven for terrorists , including Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda . The first anti-American attacks blamed directly on Osama bin Laden came on August 7th , 1998 , when terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , killing more than 220 people and wounding more than 4,000 others . Then in 2000 , a small bomb-laden boat exploded alongside the USS Cole in Yemen , killing 17 U.S. sailors and wounding 39 others . After 9/11 , the U.S. war on terror moved to Afghanistan , headquarters of bin Laden 's network . Two years later , it was onto Iraq . And now , America has taken the fight back to Africa , still in search of those original bombers in Kenya and Tanzania . Among the primary al Qaeda targets of the recent U.S. air strikes in Somalia -- Fazul Abdullah Mohammed , on the FBI 's most wanted list as the suspected mastermind of the two embassy bombings . He 's also suspected of being behind the 2002 bombing of an Israeli beach resort in Kenya that killed 10 Kenyans and three Israelis , as well as the near-simultaneous attempt to shoot down an Israeli airliner .
BN	But we have to rely on each other , and Americans have to step forward . It 's only the outrage that -- the righteous outrage of the American people . They need to call the White House . They need to say that if Ramos and Compean are not given a pardon , if they go to jail , the president has declared himself on the side of enemy . I think that 's where we 're going to have to leave it . Congressman , we thank you . We thank you for everything you 're trying to do to introduce justice to the Justice Department and to this administration . We thank you , sir . Thank you . To show is your support for Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean , you can contact the White House or the Justice Department and you can find that contact information on our website , loudobbs.com . The Border Patrol this week seized 2,000 pounds of marijuana at the Tahoa-Oadum ( ph ) Reservation in Arizona . The ton of pot was found in two separate locations on the reservation , the combined street value more than $ 2 million . As we reported here , one community on that reservation voted to ban the National Guard from using its tribal lands to patrol a section of the U.S. border with Mexico . The reservation about the size of the state of Connecticut is located on the section of the border with the highest number of illegal crossings and drug smuggling trails . Those trails , at least one of them , somebody kind of cast aside $ 2 million worth of pot . I wonder what the connection is . Border control or borders themselves wo n't be an issue if some business and political elitist groups have their way . This week a proposal for an expended so-called free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of Argentina . It 's a plan from those elitists that will cost more American jobs , cost more American sovereignty , but it would fulfill the president 's father 's vision . Bill Tucker reports . It 's not a new idea . President Bush talked about it back in 1991 . It is a big idea , a new world order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause . Now former United States Trade Ambassador Robert Zoellick is talking about it again with renewed vigor , this time a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic policy , advocating what he calls the Association of American Free Trade Agreements , a separate non government entity which would include North , Central and South America . What Zoellick is really proposing here is a stealth trade agenda . It 's not a national agenda . He 's proposing to set up what 's essentially a private organization to try to achieve what he could n't get done when he was the U.S. trade representative . And this is a business agenda . It 's an agenda that goes hand in hand with the United States , Mexico and Canada working quietly and behind the scenes to promote a common market with common deregulation for the benefit of multinational corporations . It 's an agenda that so far has resulted in an increase in U.S. corporate profits of 45 percent while wages of American workers have risen only three percent from the last five years .
BN	Let me ask you about what the Chinese government is now doing . Presumably , with their decision they 're making it sound like very fat people , people on modest incomes , single people , should n't adopt . You are , as you mentioned , a mental health professional , and you run into children who have been adopted . Do you run into kids who are suffering because of these kinds of problems ? Because of income or facial deformities or obesity ? I think the way they put their regulations in some ways is kind of peculiar , and I think if they had really talked about actuarial tables in terms of health and not just the obesity thing , it probably would have been a little easier for us to hear . And I do have to say , because I know so many wonderful single-parent families , and I can also talk about families where parents are on antidepressants and they 're wonderful parents , that initially when I heard these regulations , I had a very negative reaction . But on a global perspective , I thought more about it and I realized that it 's really a great thing for China because it means that there are fewer children being abandoned , and that 's a wonderful thing . And as one of your earlier guests mentioned , there seems to be a softening of their cultural bias against girls , and that 's a good thing . And I think what we 'll see as a result , and already are , single moms are going to -- single women who want to be parents are going to places , like India , and couples are also going to Central and South America and they 're going to other Asian countries , Eastern European , and so it will only enrich America to have just more diversity , I think , in our families . So the way you 're saying it is , however awkwardly and inelegantly , the Chinese authorities are just responding to the fact that there is enormous demand for these children and they 're trying to be more selective . Yes . What tends to be the most common problem ? Obviously , the Chinese think there 's some health problem . There 's an economic problem . If you were going to wave a magic wand and try to help all of these kids all at once , what would you suggest ? Well , I think , you know , most child welfare experts do believe that the most successful families are when there is not a blatant cultural difference , and that 's in general terms . But in fact , if you look at the history of adoption in this country , the American Association of Black Social Workers in the Seventies , and it still holds for today , had a very strong position against white families adopting black children , and it was n't only , I think it was 1994 , that the courts here ruled that race could not be a bias against cross-racial adoption . So it definitely has been the child welfare thinking that the same culture is of value , but with that said , we see so many of these rich , diverse examples of cross-cultural families that are absolutely thriving .
BN	Yes , Kyra , we know now that some people have been taken to the hospital after that train derailment , train fire , train wreck . This was a mess in Kentucky today . These are the pictures here from a little earlier . This is a train wreck in Brooks , Kentucky . Happened right around 9:00 Eastern Time today . And this thing burned , and burned and burned with huge flames and a lot of smoke heading up into the air for hours today , despite all the efforts of firefighters . Do n't know how this accident happened exactly . But we found out later exactly what was on board that was burning like this . A chemical was onboard called cyclohexane . It was a chemical there that 's flammable , and it did pose -- or does pose an inhalation hazard . So for a mile radius , people were told to evacuate , to get out and not breathe this stuff in . But again , we do know now that several people were taken to the hospital , feeling the effects of inhaling some of the smoke and some of that chemical that got into the air . However , none of those injuries being described as life-threatening . The fire crews were really -- we watched them attack this thing for hours earlier today right after this happened , really not making ground . This thing continue to even grow and get bigger . That 's a better vantage point of it there , a wider shot of what was happening . But it caused all kinds of problems , traffic issues as well . Highway had to be shutdown for a little bit . You 've seen some of those crews we 're talking about . They ended up pulling out , the fire crews , saying we 're just going to let this thing burn itself out , and it got away from it . Still waiting for details on exactly how this accident happened , so we 're still trying to get more information -- Kyra . OK , T.J. , thanks . The U.S. and the U.N. , a love/hate relationship that 's been light on the love for years now . But will the new U.N. secretary-general enjoy a honeymoon with the Bush administration ? President Bush is sitting down this hour with Ban-Ki Moon . And our Suzanne Malveaux just left a White House briefing -- Suzanne . SUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDEN Well , Kyra , of course , the White House trying to garner more support for the new Iraq plan . President Bush hosting today Ban-Ki Moon . As you mentioned , of course , really a mixed relationship with the United Nations . Under Kofi Annan , of course , U.N. Security Council did not authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq or the Iraq War . President Bush at that time was questioning the very relevancy of this international organization . Well , Ban-Ki Moon is a different kind of leader . He is soft-spoken , mild-mannered , but in his first press conference , he did make a couple of things known that there are differences with the United States . He took issue , expressed concerns with the U.S. airstrikes against southern Somalia recently on an Al Qaeda target . He said , while he understood the necessity of the attack , he was concerned that perhaps there would be civilian casualties , or even escalate the hostilities in that area .
BN	All right , Gerri Willis , good to see you . Thank you . Live in the CNN NEWSROOM , Tony Harris and Heidi Collins . Among our top stories this morning , slipping an sliding from coast to coast , really . Ice , snow , freezing rain and bitter cold making for another miserable day across a big part of the country . Wow . That 's a lot of snow . Not much comfort in Comfort , Texas . That town and many others in the lone star state paralyzed by a blast of ice and snow . A 300-mile stretch of Interstate 10 shut down after snow started falling over a layer of ice . And more misery in the Midwest . Nearly a foot of snow has fallen so far on parts of Indiana . And to New Hampshire . A struggle just to stay warm . Thousands of homes and businesses still without power after Monday 's ice storm there . A slippery mess . Ice and snow causing a lot of problems in Portland , Oregon . Schools shut down and a rash of car crashes . KATU 's Brian Barker reports . In Tiger ( ph ) , this may be the only reliable way to navigate the roads . Nearby a cash smashes through a fence . On Shoals Ferry ( ph ) , some car just spin their wheels . And everywhere you look , cars and trucks are stopped and traffic is snarled . I was coming this way on Walnut and this SUV, that one right there , was coming down 135th sideways , so I stopped in time . Wherever there is even the slightest of hills , cars careen out of control . This SUV ( INAUDIBLE ) bounces back and forth in a slow-motion , out-of-control slide . Boulevard . All of these cars are stacked up here along the shoulder , because they ca n't make it up the off-ramp . This is too steep for them . This is hardly any hill at all . Can't go up the hill , at all . Have you seen a plow come through here ? Nope . Reporter : Not one plow ? UNIDENTIFIED MAL No. And you 've been sitting here two hours ? Two-and-a-half hours . Olivia Helmet ( ph ) sat stuck on this off ramp for four hours . It 's 12:20 . You 've been here since 7:00 in the morning ? yes . You morons ! Stay home . Driving anywhere is treacherous . Folks should stay home and stay off the road . And even as snowplows bat to clear the roads , the city worries about the next 24 hours . Our concern is that about the time it gets dark , it 's going to get really icy . And I really think that the mayor is making the right call in terms of sending people home . As snow on the roads melts in places , it 's already beginning to freeze again , and the sliding has never stopped . We 've been telling you about the school bus accident in Grant County , Kentucky this morning . Want to get an update on the rail there . Nancy Howe is on the line with us from Grant County schools . Nancy , good morning to you . Good morning . Nancy , thanks for your time . What can you tell us about this accident ? Just to confirm that , yes , we did have an accident this morning . It was a bus that was transporting 17 students from Pritna ( ph ) Mount Zion Elementary to the Grant County Middle School . All 17 students were Grant County middle school students . We did take everyone to our local hospital , which is St . Elizabeth Hospital , Grant County , where they were checked out , and we had three students that moved on to larger hospitals . HARRI
BN	Oh , of course it 's going to go on a few more years . And the real question that we have to ask ourselves , Wolf , is what America 's role is going to be in that next step that the Iraqis are going to have to take . They are going to be the ones that will determine the fate of their country . We ca n't do that . We can help them . A number of the Baker-Hamilton Commission recommendations put forward , I thought , was representative of a good , new bipartisan foundation the president could have seized upon , using diplomacy , using our military force , using our influence to bring together a new framework , a new frame of reference for the future . How this all plays out in Iraq , I do n't know . But I think what some of us are saying here , we 're no longer going to just quietly stand by , as we have done , literally , for four years , and let more of our young Americans be thrown into this battle when they cannot change the outcome . This is an internal issue and the Iraqis themselves are going to have to sort this out . They must want their own freedom , their own future , more than we want it for them . All right , Senator , the White House has already said today that the resolution that you and Senator Levin and Senator Biden want to put forward is not going to affect the president 's policies . They 're going to go forward with their surge , as they call it , the increase of the U.S. troops . What else should be done if they ignore this symbolic , non - binding resolution ? Well , let 's start with the fact that we have a form of government , Wolf , that represents co-equal branches of government . Article 1 of the Constitution is not the presidency , it 's the Congress . We have separation of powers , as it should be . But we have a co-equal branch of government . We need to be part of any resolution in foreign policy or any policy for our country . We have essentially walked away from that the last four years . So when the president talks about or his administration spokesmen say that regardless of what the Senate does or the Congress does in any resolution , we 're not going to pay heed to that , I think they 'll want to review that , because here is the way a democracy works , if people have forgotten . November 7th , the people of this country changed the management in Congress . It was over one issue more than any other , and it was Iraq . Seventy-three percent that I 've seen in the last poll , and I believe it was your poll , last week , 73 percent of the people of America said that they disapproved of this administration 's handling of Iraq . That should tell everyone something . There 's accountability in leadership . There should be . There is accountability in politics . Right . Now , this is just the beginning , Wolf . This thing is going to play out over the next few months , with appropriations , more resolutions . You saw Senator Clinton 's introduction of a bill today . This is just the beginning .
BN	That 's what the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , told me on Sunday . Right . This is an important statement . Right . And you need 60 votes . Will you have 60 votes to break that filibuster ? I -- the answer is , I do n't know whether we will have 60 votes to break it . But think of what the statement says , Wolf -- a sitting president , with the opposition of every major political -- every major -- almost every major military leader , leaders in his own party , two former Republican secretaries of state , former secretaries of defense , all of them telling him : Mr. President , do n't do what you 're about to do . And , then , on top of that , you come along , and you have a bipartisan resolution saying , do n't do it , Mr. President , and there 's -- they have got to filibuster it to stop it ? What is wrong with Russ Feingold 's recommendation ; you simply use the power of the purse , which the Constitution gives the legislative branch of the U.S. government ... Nothing . ... to stop funding this war ? Nothing wrong with it . The question is , can that be done quickly ? And the answer is probably not . We have a constitutional right to do that . I have drafted a resolution , which I will be introducing later , a law that says : Look , you have no authority to go to war in Iran , Mr. President , like you seem to be intimating you do , nor into Syria . In addition to that , we have the power to -- and I 'm working on a resolution that will say , the authorization for use of force that we gave you three-and-a-half years ago is no longer valid . There 's a new authorization to use , and here are the limitations on your use . There are constitutional ways to do ... What about Hillary Clinton , Chris Dodd , Barack Obama ? They want a cap on how many troops could be serving in Iraq . Do you think that 's a good idea ? In principle , it 's a good idea , but , in practice , it may be difficult . Let me explain what I mean by that , Wolf . If you talk to the Pentagon , you talk to people who know how the military works , we have thousands of troops outside of Iraq , over the horizon , in case our troops get in trouble . What happens if there is a real problem ? Does that limit the president being able to surge troops in to rescue American troops , number one ? Number two , the way this works , Wolf , is that there is always a movement , in terms of when we ramped up troops . That is , you extend troops who are there , while new troops are coming in . There is almost always an overlap . Then , the number comes down . It gets pretty dicey figuring out how to micromanage that . I think the easier way to do this -- will be politically harder -- is to reauthorize and , with significant limitation , on what authority the president has in Iraq , period , period -- in other words , a new authorization ... All right .
BN	Just some symbolism here . ... 40,000 people . Yes , and that 's what it is . So Mark Fields now announcing that he is in fact not going to be using the corporate jet . Now , our colleagues over at cnnmoney .com , Chris Isadore ( ph ) , did some math on this and called up Northwest Airlines and said if that he were to fly every weekend first class , it would be probably about $ 90,000 a year . The bill that Ford has said for at least one quarter of the year , and if you extrapolate that to the whole year , $ 860,000 is what it 's been costing Ford . So roughly a tenth . Yes , roughly a tenth . So symbolism . You know , there is something to be said for the efficiency , but this is a world where ... S. O'BRIE And how many jobs could you get for that $ 800,000 ? Yes . And the interesting thing here is that this is not an industry people want to hate . The car industry in the United States has failed quite miserably over the last few years , but there 's such hope , there 's so much investment in it . We all know somebody who works there , or we drive the cars , or we invest in the company . So there 's goodwill to it -- toward the companies , and the feeling was , this is ruining the goodwill when this kind of news gets out there . So they 're making the changes . GM 's equivalent executives do n't fly corporate jets on a regular basis . Oh , they do n't ? No. Not to their homes . Nor do the other Ford executives . All right . So all these guys taking their shoes off , just like the rest of us . Yes . All right . Thank you . That 's right . All right , Ali . You have a good weekend . You , too . Thank you . Let 's take a look at CNN this weekend , as a matter of fact . Let 's go to T.J. Holmes at the CNN Center with a preview . Hello , T.J. Hey . Good morning , guys . This weekend , like it seems like every weekend lately , we 're going to be talking about weather again . Keeping a close eye on it . You 're going to want to tune in for all that up-to-the-minute information on another winter storm that , yes , is on the way . And we 've got kind of a nicer story we 're going to tell you about the weather as well . We 're going to hear from a lottery winner who does n't even have time to spend his loot . He 's helping people out who have been hard-hit by the winter storms . Pretty heart-warming story here . That 's going to be in our " WaterCooler . " Also , dolphins in danger . Scores of animals beaching themselves on Cape Cod in Long Island . We 're going to talk to animal expert Jack Hannah about what 's behind this bizarre behavior .

We like to think of the Fisher House as a home for all service members who are returning back from war , who have a place to always go to . So glad to help . That 's CNN 's Robin Meade reporting . While the Hummer auction brought in more than $ 1 million , your donations are still very much needed . Just go to www.fisherhouse .org . By the way , not done yet . 25 minutes the man who shelled out that $ 1 million is going to be right here with us , telling us why he did it and what it means to him . Also in two weeks now since two boys reunited with their families . The suspect is behind bars , but so many questions are now coming to the forefront . Did Shawn Hornbeck try to reach out to police ? If not , why not ? Is Michael Devlin linked to other kidnappings ? Our panel 's going to be taking on some of those tough questions . We 'll be talking to them next . Up next , though , you probably thought that she was already in the presidential race . Now Hillary Clinton makes it official . And she wants to enter your living room while she does so . Much more ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM. I announced today that I 'm forming a presidential exploratory committee . I 'm not just starting a campaign though , I 'm beginning a conversation with you , with America . Because we all need to be part of the discussion , if we 're all going to be part of the solution .
BN	Also , the suspect in the kidnapping of two Missouri boys is talking . Insight into the mind of Michael Devlin . It 's the monster known as the Bike Path Rapist has been taken into custody . The monster , behind bars , police say . This is a man , police say , lived a double life for 25 years . The Bike Path Rapist case : Who is this guy ? We 'll tell you next . Now in the news . Yesterday proved to be the third deadliest day for the U.S. military in Iraq . Twenty five service members were killed . Five of those deaths reported in Iraq 's Anbar Province . And in Karbala , five more U.S. soldiers died trying to repel a militia grenade attack on a security coordination center . For the second consecutive day a White House hopeful takes to the Internet to announce their candidacy . New Mexico governor and former energy secretary Bill Richardson says he 's joining the presidential race . If elected he will be the very first ever U.S. president of Hispanic decent . Call it the deep freeze . Deep in the heart of Texas . Here are shots of Amarillo where a half foot more snow has fallen overnight . Parts of neighboring New Mexico could get as much as a foot of snow tonight as well . Amber alert in Indiana . We told you about this yesterday . Police say they have found two cars used in connection with this abduction . Still no sign , though , of Kimberly Walker and her four children . And the man suspected of kidnapping them , her ex boyfriend , 30-year-old Jerry White . Shots are involved in this story , at least in the case of another man before this . CNN 's Keith Oppenheim is joining us now from the phone . He is in Chicago , he has been following some of the details in the story . I do n't remember when , Keith , I have heard police just come out and say as soon as something like this happens , and they use these words , these children are in extreme danger . Absolutely right , Rick . They are saying that Jerry White is armed and dangerous and as far as I can say from my conversations with them so far , they have n't been getting a lot of meaningful leads yet . Jerry White , they tell me , is a 30-year-old man who went to his ex-girlfriend 's home , Kimberly Walker , and he abducted her and the four children from the home as of Saturday morning . Police also say that Jerry White is the father of the children but they were never married . Investigators say that over the weekend Jerry White came to her home in Elkhart and shot the boyfriend of Walker 's sister twice . The shooting victim is in critical condition . In the meantime , investigators say that White forced Kimberly Walker and the four children to go with him and that he may have gone to the Chicago area where he has relatives . But Rick , they are not sure about that . Because the problem is there are two cars police thought Jerry White might have been using . Both of those cars were recovered in Elkhart , Indiana . So the bottom line is investigators are n't sure what vehicle he might have been using in this kidnapping .
BN	That 's right , Don , and we heard about layoffs very recently from the same company . This is a bitter pill to swallow for Pfizer workers , especially on a day when the company is reporting better than expected profits . The company says it plans to slash about 10,000 jobs or 10 percent of its global work force . That includes the elimination of more than 2,000 U.S. sales positions that Pfizer disclosed two month ago . The announcement made by Pfizer 's CEO , Jeffrey Kindler , about an hour ago comes as part of a broad restructuring , which includes the closure of two plants and three research sites . Three of those plants in Michigan . One is in Brooklyn , New York , and one is in Omaha , Nebraska . Pfizer 's goal : to save up to $ 2 billion a year by the end of '08 . Saving money is something Pfizer needs to do . It 's been struggling with the loss of patents on key drugs , including its blockbuster anti- depressant , Zoloft . Zoloft sales plunged nearly 80 percent in the fourth quarter , causing Pfizer 's overall quarterly revenue to come in flat . And something we talked about late last year , Don , is that its most hopeful drug was pulled very late in the experiment -- in late trials because of some very serious injuries and health problems associated with it . Wow . And they 're also in the news for another reason today , as well . Legal reason . That 's right . Something we talked about this morning , because there was a press conference this morning by a major AIDS treatment group which is suing Pfizer over the way the company markets its blockbuster impotence pill , Viagra . The AIDS Health Care Foundation says Pfizer irresponsibly and illegally promotes the recreational use of the little purple pill . The group says that practice has led to risky behavior by men and an increase in HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases . Basically says it 's become sort of a party drug . Pfizer sees it very differently . It denies the group 's claim and says it 's , quote , " committed to the safe and appropriate use of Viagra , " end quote . And it encourages men to see a doctor for proper diagnosis . That is threat latest from Wall Street . Coming up , drivers got some relief at the pumps this month . I 'll tell you if that trend is likely to continue . Oh , my ears perked up with that one . And you keep abreast of everything . You notice how all of these political candidates are going online to make their announcements . Pretty interesting . The question is , Susan , will the mouse roar in '08 ? Some presidential candidates see the Internet as their ticket to the White House . We 're spinning a political web next in the NEWSROOM. Hello , everyone . I 'm Don Lemon , live at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta . And I 'm Betty Nguyen , in for Kyra Philips today . A bunch of new Internet launches that have nothing to with the tech industry and everything to do with presidential politics . We 're going to talk about cyber campaigns and whether they 'll click with voters .
BN	Heidi . The segue . Remember the segue ? Elaine Quijano coming to us from outside the White House this morning . Elaine , thank you . President Bush facing an unfriendly majority on Capitol Hill and a public that is showing its anger as well . Here 's a sampling from the latest CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll . More than half of those polled , 55 percent , say the Bush presidency has been a failure and nearly two-third of American oppose President Bush 's plan to send more U.S. troops to Iraq , 35 percent support it . CNN is the place to watch the State of the Union Address . Primetime coverage begins tonight at 7:00 Eastern . You can watch a special two hour edition of " The Situation Room . " Then , President Bush 's address live on CNN, followed by the Democratic response . Then , 10:30 Eastern , Anderson Cooper has reaction from around the world , followed by a special midnight edition of " Larry King Live . " The best political team on television has you covered . The power of words . Can President Bush sell his vision to a skeptical Congress ? We 'll talk with a former presidential speech writer about the challenge coming up . Santa Ana winds , steep terrain . An uphill battle to be sure against this southern California wildfire . An update in the NEWSROOM. Let 's check out the big board . The New York Stock Exchange , oh , an hour into the trading day . The Dow up 10 , which is a nice reversal from yesterday when the Dow closed at about 88 points down for the day . We will continue to watch the numbers and the business headlines throughout the morning here in the NEWSROOM. Live in the CNN NEWSROOM , Heidi Collins and Tony Harris . A Senate confirmation hearing underway right now for General David Petraeus . He is President Bush 's choice to command U.S. forces in Iraq . You see Senator Ted Kennedy questioning General Petraeus at this very moment . Want to go ahead and let you listen in to some sound from the general 's opening comments regarding specifically the fact that the deployment of the U.S. troops and Iraqi troops will begin by going into nine different sectors across the city of Baghdad . That has raised some concern , especially because they will be establishing themselves in not forward operating bases , but instead inside those particular posts all across the city . Let 's listen to how that will work , according to the general . Together , with Iraqi forces , a persistent presence in these neighborhoods will be essential . Different approaches will be required in different locations . Whatever the approach , though , the objective will be to achieve sufficient security to provide the space and time for the Iraqi government to come to grips with the tough decisions its members must make to enable Iraq to move forward . In short , it is not just that there will be additional forces in Baghdad , it is what they will do and how they will do it that is important . And also a reminder , if you would like to see more of these Senate confirmation hearings , they are going on live right now and you can tune into CNN Pipeline if you 'd like to watch .
BN	To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy . Ladies and gentlemen , nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East , to succeed in Iraq , and to spare the American people from this danger . This is where matters stand tonight , in the here and now . I 've spoken with many of you in person . I respect you and the arguments you 've made . We went into this largely united in our assumptions and in our convictions . And whatever you voted for , you did not vote for failure . Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq , and I ask you to give it a chance to work . And I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way . The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others . And that 's why it 's important to work together , so our nation can see this great effort through . Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation . That 's why I 've proposed to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror , made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties . We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us . We 'll show our enemies abroad that we 're united in the goal of victory . And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military , so that the American armed forces are ready for all of the challenges ahead . Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years . A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps . Such a corps would function much like our military reserve . Such a corps would function much like our military reserve . It would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them . It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time . Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we are not in this struggle alone . We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism . In Iraq , multnational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations . We 're are working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq 's government . The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons . With the other members of the quartet -- the U.N. , the European Union and Russia -- we are pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security .
BN	.it` s all about the next big thing . I` m very , very , very competitive . And I` m - and I` m only happy when I` m winning . That was CNN` s Kyra Phillips for SHOWBIZ TONIGHT " American Idol " premieres on January 16 . Yesterday we asked you to vote on our SHOWBIZ TONIGHT " Question of the Day . " The Donald Trump-Rosie O` Donnell war of words does n` t seem to be letting up . So " Donald Versus Rosie : Has the whole thing gone too far ? " Very one-sided here . Ninety-one percent of you say yes ; 9 percent of you say no . Here are some of the e-mails we received : Victoria from Minnesota says , " I am getting really tired of the whole argument . They should grow up and put their energy into something constructive . " And Shirley from New York thinks , " Donald is way too professional to take this so-called fight with Rosie as far as he has . It makes him look foolish . " No question about that . You know , Melania , Donald` s wife , usually pretty quiet as far as public things go . Yes , pretty reticent to talk . Usually lets Donald do all the talking . Well , she is actually speaking out , finally - this time about her husband` s fierce feud with Rosie . We`ll get into that next . Also , A.J. , Britney Spears is speaking out as well . For the first time , she` s talking about the outrage over her pantyless partying . We`ve also got this : It was a cell phone that recorded the n-word rant . ( INAUDIBLE ) It was a cell phone that captured Mel Gibson` s partying before his rant . Well , you know , SHOWBIZ TONIGHT picked Britney Spears as the most controversial celebrity of the year . Now we`ve got the most controversial gadget out there . And we are dialing that up next . Welcome back to SHOWBIZ TONIGHT , TV` s most provocative entertainment news show . I` m A.J. Hammer in New York . Well , as much as we hoped , begged and , quite frankly , prayed for this Donald Trump-Rosie O` Donnell nasty war of words to just go away , it` s still going strong . Yesterday we told you that Donald` s daughter , Ivanka , ripped into Rosie . Now Trump` s wife , Melania , who really never says much of anything , is letting her have it . MELANIA TRUMP , DONALD TRUMP` S WIF Well , I think she has a real issue and problem with herself , anger inside . And she need to work on that . It` s in - in herself . And if you watched " The View , " you could see how hatred she has toward my husband , you know ? And nobody asked her to ask - to tell any story anyway . So what` s her problem ? You know ? I do n` t know if we`re going to be hearing from the baby next . So that was from " Good Day , L.A. , " by the way , out there in Hollywood . Monday is going to be very interesting , of course , because that` s when Rosie returns on " The View " from her vacation . And you know we`ll be watching . Well , after a lot of debating , name-calling , hair-pulling - it got pretty ugly . After all of that , we here at SHOWBIZ TONIGHT picked Britney Spears as the most controversial celebrity of 2006 .
BN	Well we focus so much about drinking and driving , tell them to slow down , all those things . And you forget , you know , you 're doing that -- you are giving them that advice , and you 're talking on the phone while you 're driving . What 's the message ? Right . And everybody is working on their Blackberry when they 're not supposed to be . And everybody is eating and -- Blackberrying and driving -- do n't do that . They do . That 's the message you send . We knew 2006 was a bad year for Ford . But how bad was it ? About 24 minutes past the hour , Carrie Lee , " Minding Your Business " . Historically bad , I guess you could say . Historically bad , would be an understatement , Miles . The numbers just in a few moments ago . Ford posting its worst annual loss in its 103-year history ; $ 12.7 billion in losses in 2006 . Nearly half of that , $ 5.8 billion , lost in the fourth quarter alone . Bottom line , we know this story , high gas prices have put a crimp in sales , there is less demands for Fords bread & butter trucks and SUVs . Japanese rivals continue to gain ground with their more fuel efficient cars . Also , looking ahead , analysts say that 2007 is not going to be a great year for Detroit either . In the case of Ford they 're not expecting a big rebound . General Motors will report on Tuesday . We will hear from Daimler-Chrysler mid-February . One caveat , going forward , President Bush 's plan to raise fuel economy standards , if that happens it could force Detroit to come up to speed , compared to other makers , like Toyota and Honda . But , of course , Miles and Soledad , Detroit would have to spend money to get there and raise their standards . But that is the latest from Ford . We 'll certainly be watching that stock today . All right . Carrie Lee , thank you very much . Top stories of the morning are coming up next . The war in Iraq , and the war on Capitol Hill . A Senate push to stop the build up of troops .

BN	It 's a game about training journalists for the rigors of covering war zones . But can an interactive video game for the public really address the issues involved ? Well , the designers of Global Conflict 's Palestine gave me an exclusive look . At first glance , the standard role playing videogame . Perhaps their location is Jerusalem . And your character is a journalist facing ethical dilemmas . SIMON EGENFEIDT-NIELSEN , SERIOUS GAME The reason why we made this game was basically to try and take a new approach to trend issues . It seems like a lot of times , you 're , you know , quickly flashing by a CNN newspaper , something else . And these games give you a chance to dig a bit deeper . And hopefully also catch some people that might not really take a big interest in trend issues . So the journalist is meeting his editor . EGENFEIDT-NIELSE Yes , Algeri ( ph ) , the first conversation with the editor . And each ( INAUDIBLE ) is basically about you writing a story . You can choose from three different angles . And the angle you choose will kind of control what quotes you should get . Great . EGENFEIDT-NIELSE So - and I basically have the Israeli newspaper Datz ( ph ) , the Palestinian newspaper Akutz ( ph ) , and the European newspaper " The Independent . " And you choose whichever newspaper you want to write for ? EGENFEIDT-NIELSE Yes . We 'll try to go for the Israeli here . And then they 're saying what Jeraks ( ph ) is interested in . So it 's interesting the story about the way in which IDF protects the Israeli citizens against terrorism . This is actually quite a typical situation . You - the soldier is saying now I can feel it . Something 's happening . There must have gotten a hold of that terrorist . See , here he comes . And the journalist has a choice of either two questions . Is n't it kind of odd to call him a terrorist like that without any proof ? Or he can ask how do you guys know he 's a terrorist ? And depending on which answer you give , it will predetermine the response . EGENFEIDT-NIELSE Yes . .of the Israeli army soldier . EGENFEIDT-NIELSE And also , actually , if you build up trust up `til now , he might also be more forgiving . So you can actually get further with the critical questions than if you had been critical already at the start . OK . So I say how do you guys know he 's a terrorist ? Yes . And the answer is from the Israeli soldier , " I do n't know . I just listen to the commander . He always has control of things . He says we have good and reliable information . " And then I can either say , " I think the commander 's being a little rough with that guy . How can you guys even be sure he 's done anything , " which is sure to get a reaction oftentimes . Or I can say , " I can see that the commander is giving that terrorist what he deserves . " And again , depending on which answer I go for . EGENFEIDT-NIELSE Yes . .that will predetermine how far I get with this raid . And this - is there a possibility I can be kicked out of the raid all together and sent back home ?
BN	And then we 'll look at the case of this teenager , sentenced to 10 years in prison for consensual sex with a teenage girl . Scooter Libby on trial says he 's a scapegoat . The former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney on trial for perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the exposure of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative . Our legal experts will discuss the case in a moment . But first , CNN 's Kelli Arena describes another aide 's testimony that could hurt Libby 's defense . Kathy Martin 's ( ph ) testimony offered rare insight into the inner workings of the vice president 's office and the personal efforts by the vice president himself to control information . What you 're seeing is this -- for the first time some real disarray at the senior levels of the White House . Martin , who is Vice President Cheney 's communications chief , suggested that her boss and his chief of staff Scooter Libby were obsessed back in 2003 with gathering information about Joe Wilson , a Bush critic . At the time , Wilson was challenging the Bush administration 's justification for the war in Iraq based on information he uncovered during a trip to Africa . They obviously did n't want to let any little spark catch in the fire and they were n't going let one of these frontal attacks go unanswered . Wilson claimed that he was sent on his mission by the vice president . But Martin described how Cheney tried to distance himself from Wilson , how the vice president personally dictated talking points for dealing with the press , her notes in evidence telling her to say , quote , " He did not travel at my request . Do n't know him . " She testified Libby told her to actually call the CIA to get names of reporters working on stories about Wilson so that the vice president could direct a spin operation with Libby as the front man . The intrigue at the White House is playing out in the course of this because it 's generally so secret . Martin 's story flies in the face of Libby 's defense , which claims that he was caught up in so many other issues he did n't pay much attention to Wilson . The bigger deal of this was inside the White House , the less credible his explanation of misrecollection becomes . Libby is charged with lying about how and when he found out that Wilson 's wife , Valerie Plame , worked at the CIA . Martin testified she told him in June of 2003 . But Libby claims he did n't find out until a month later . This is a case about deception . This is a case about lies . It 's also a case that has most of Washington wondering what other secrets are about to be exposed . Kelli Arena , CNN, Washington . Let 's turn to our legal experts about the Libby Case . Avery Freedman is a civil rights attorney and law professor . Good to see you , Avery . Nice to see you . And Richard Herman is a New York criminal defense attorney . Good to see you as well , Richard . Hi , Fred . All right . Richard , let me begin with you .
BN	Well , you know , General Casey made a lot of predictions that did not come true , about the potential for troop cuts , about the abating of violence . And he did preside over a very bad year in Iraq . My sources tell me , though , that while McCain is very upset about this , that he will not block Casey 's confirmation . You know , it only takes one senator to do that . And it looks like it 's going to be a rough ride for General Casey , but the -- the betting is that he will be confirmed as Army chief of staff . The same question to you , Spider , is it fair to use the word failed about any of the people who have led us in Iraq at this point ? I do n't think it 's fair at all . Every one of the leaders that has been in Iraq that are in uniform that are prosecuting this war that will exist for many , many years , circumstances that they could shape , they shpd . And the conditions and the requirements and the resources that they are handed , they salute and they make the best of it . George Casey is one of those absolutely first rate leaders that will do a great job in his next job , as the chief of staff leading and restructuring the United States Army . Good choice . Thanks , Jamie McIntyre over according to the Pentagon . Spider is going to stick around with us .

And I 'm sure we 'll have many more to go , but it just is nice to know that there was an end up . There was an end . There will be bittersweet days ahead . This week , the Pentagon said it 's extending the tours for more than 3,000 soldiers with the 10th Mountain Division . Some soldiers will immediately redeploy to Afghanistan or they 'll support NATO forces in quelling violence there . More U.S. troops going into Iraq . More on the way . What can they do to keep themselves safe and get the job done ? How can they turn this fight around ? CNN military analyst Brigadier General James " Spider " Marks is back with some answers . Spider , let 's get right to the map and take a look at this . This is the general region . Hopefully I 'll give you some answers . Hopefully . This is the region . There 's Iraq in the middle in red . What do you do , if you 're General Petraeus , you 're the new troops coming in , you 're the old troops who are there . What do you do ? Well , first of all , the intellectual precedes the physical . We 've thought about this . We 've designed a plan . We 've now asked for some forces .

CT	Mm . -- " I 'm from the United States , bow down to me " or -- Or , um , you know , " I deserve preferential treatment " . Right . I 'm sort of an international person myself . Oh , good . Yeah . So , um , I -- I see both sides 'cause I 've lived -- Okay . -- outside America for a long time and I 've lived inside America for a long time . Okay . Actually eight years each to be exact . Oh , okay , okay . But , I mean , like , just looking -- you 're right , what you 're saying . Like , there are Americans who are intelligent , they see what 's going on . Like they 're -- they 're of the p - the point of view that , like , " Okay , this is who we are but there are also other people who have their other cultures and understandings and we should respect them for it " . Uh-huh . This is really funny 'cause when I first came here , like , a lot of people were all about , " Respect me , respect me , respect me , respect me" . It was like a catchphrase . Every single TV show h - had the words respect in it . Uh-huh . But , like , over here right now , the actions that they 're doing , that the government is saying and how the government is representative of the population , what they 're doing is not respectful . No, I agree . Ah , they 're kind of forcing , are n't they ? Mm . I mean , it 's just , I do n't know . Like d- -- ah , well , spoils my point . I mean , like , just coming from the outside and coming from the inside , there have been some Americans who are just like , " Oh , this is who I am" . And 'specially , unfortunately before September eleventh that was on the rise . Uh-huh . They were totally there , like , going , " Oh , we do n't care , this , that " . I mean , there 's sort of less now . Right . B- but with this , like , um , war being , like , successful and everything , I really hope people wo n't make the mistake of starting to -- start being big again . Uh-huh . Because those terrorist groups are still out there . Although they 're not doing anything right now , they might get irked into doing something else . You think they 've kind of gone underground ? Oh yeah , definitely . Yeah , yeah . I mean , I do n't know what else they 're doing , nor do I want to , but -- Uh-huh . -- they 're probably gonna wait 'til things have calmed down and everyone 's , like , going , " Nah , nah , nah " again , then they 'll probably -- Right . -- find some other way of doing it . Do you think nine eleven alerted us to the fact that these people are out -- are out there and hate the US as much as they do ? Yes , but in the wrong way . Yeah . In the beginning it was -- it was like -- it was sort of decent in that we were all thinking , " Why ? "
CT	-- and my Dad currently still resides in Kuwait even as we speak . So Your English is very good . thank you . There 's -- Well , my -- my parents are Nigerian actually . Uh-huh . Um -- Oh , well -- So Ibo was my first language -- Well , your -- your -- your -- your -- your -- -- and then English my second . -- your English accent is , uh , remarkably American . It i- -- it is . It 's -- You 've done quite well in that regard -- -- and you 're probably throwing the linguistics study off -- off the -- I know , I 'm sure I am . That 's not our problem though . Yeah , so , um , it 's even more so a personal thing to me . Mhm . I did n't understand it the first time , I still do n't understand it this time as to -- Mhm . -- you know , why this is going on . It 's -- -- it 's just crazy , I mean , millions -- not millions , but so many people are -- so many civilians are getting hurt over there . So , I mean , when you turn on the news , you constantly see , you know , innocent children , mothers , men , families being torn apart , being hurt , being wounded over , as you said , Bush being a child , being a boy -- Yeah . -- playing with these toys , you know -- Well , it 's a -- -- trying to avenge -- Right . -- whatever between his father and Saddam . Right , so , um , you know , a lot -- a lot of this , uh , you know , this game , h - h - having -- having had US military in the family for all generations prior -- Mhm . -- to mine , uh , I -- I do think I understand a little bit about the -- the military outlook on the things as well , and , uh , to some extent a lot of the stuff that we see media wise is so orchestrated . Yeah , that 's true . Um , and , you know , a - a - and all parties are orchestrating , uh , you know , and both sides are providing propaganda in the extreme . Um , I do have my doubts as to the extreme level of civilian casualties , uh , primarily because an awful lot of regular forces on the , uh -- on the opposing side , uh , quickly doffed their uniforms , uh , you know , they 're not following the , oh , the accepted procedures . Mm . Uh , such that an awful lot of the civilian personnel that are crying in the hospitals are not necessarily civilian personnel , certainly the adult males , the vast majority are not civilians . Mm . Uh , the -- the others , that 's , in a lot of respects , that 's because of the -- one , th - the methods that are used by the opposition , uh , you know , the , uh , if you look back at some of the , uh , some of the coverage that was provided of -- of the prior , uh , conflict with , uh , um , European citizens who did not get out soon enough --
CT	Um , I do n't know that they 'll tolerate us for months there , still fighting . Uh , of course they ca n't stop us , but they can make a big outcry . Right . Um , I do n't know . Y - you 're right though , if they can find Hussein and his sons and whoever the -- his top leaders are , they 'll wrap it up real fast . I had heard that , uh , Saddam had murdered his own sons , but I do n't know if that was just a rumor , or -- 'cause I had heard it secondhand , not off the news -- Really ? -- and I do n't know if this is true or not . That 's interesting . Why would he have , did they say ? Um , my source -- Yeah . -- which is just a manager at work , so not too reliable -- Yeah . -- but all the same , said , uh , they were doing something like , um , drinking American beverage or something , just , you know -- Uh-huh . -- a ridiculous reason . Oh . And so it was just retribution ? Right . That does sound like an urban legend , I 'm afraid . It could have happened , though . Oh -- I do n't know . I have n't watched the news in the last few days , so Yeah . I did n't , 'cause , um , I get so tired of it , and my husband was away fishing , but he 's back now , so I 'm sure I 'll get all caught up . But I saw enough of it to , you know , see that they felt we were nearly done , but then last night a young woman reporter was there , and I do n't know if you happened to see that , but I mean , she kept looking behind her and finally she just said , " That 's too close " and she kind of ducked down . No, I did n't catch that . So , they 're still fighting . . So I think , by and large , the real thing is all done , the real fighting . I hope so , 'cause I -- I do n't think that we went about it the right way , in Bush making such a large deal out of it -- Mm . -- and the -- the whole United Nations -- What do you think would have been better ? I really do n't know . I do n't know -- Yeah . -- how it would have been handled better , or how it could of , or if it -- -- would have been different under Gore , or an- any of these other declarations by the people . Yeah . I -- I do n't know , um , I tend to think that Gore , frankly , is kind of wimpy , so I do n't think -- -- I do n't think -- I do n't think he would have known what to do , and he 'd have just followed advisors , but , um , as far as whether -- I -- it did seem like Bush just -- this was just -- he was itching to do this .
CT	Okay . -- you know , I 'd do something like that . Cool . You know , and have -- and it would have , like , something where they could , you know , win stuff or even a situation where you get so many points , you turn them in and we give you savings bonds . Whoa . You know . Since money 's no object . I hear you . I hear you . You know . Or , if that did n't work out , then I 'd sell information . Sell information ? Yeah . Sell information . You know , how to things . Okay . How to books , how to manuals -- Right , right , right . -- you know , not only would I sell them through the , um , mail I 'd sell them on the , um , I 'd open a little store , hard to find items -- Okay . Okay . -- you know . Uh-huh . Good idea . Good idea . You know . It 's -- when money 's no object , there 's so many things you can do . Absolutely . Absolutely . Yeah . So , um , the whole thing about , you know , you got to get incorporated , you got to get , you know -- Well , really , that 's not really that hard . That only costs like a hundred dollars to get incorporated -- Oh . Okay . Okay . I 've -- I 've checked . Actually , I have my own business -- Oh , see . -- you know , but money is an object , so it 's not like I can just go run out and rent a building or whatever , you know -- Oh , man . You did n't tell me you had this arcade . No, I do n't have the arcade -- -- not yet , I 'm working on it . I 'm working on it . Right . Right , right . You know , I have a vending business . I sell things that people need , colognes , perfumes -- Okay . Okay . -- you know , depending on what the weather is -- Oh , okay . -- I sell umbrellas , fans -- So , at like a , um -- -- um , baseball cards , I sell whatever somebody wants . People buy . I hear you . Yeah . I hear you . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Yeah . So , it 's not that hard get -- to -- to incorporate and actually -- No. -- open a business ? It 's only -- it 's only about a hundred dollars . I mean , the main thing with me is because I work the -- on -- I work out of my house , but I also work on the street , is making sure I have all my permits and stuff , peddlers ' licenses and stuff like that -- Uh-huh . Uh-huh . -- you know . And then , I -- when I do go out in the street and sell , if I sell in front of a business or whatever I have to sell something other than what they carry .
CT	-- not spend on no credit cards , buy now pay later thingy and I figured that that thing I -- I -- I 'm with you on that one right there . If -- if I guess the older you get , for me , the older I get is a little more difficult to , um , save money -- Yeah . -- and -- and not buy into that buy now and pay later thingy because it 's so convenient . When you have a credit card in your hand , you got no cash , you know , you need something , something from the store , you need a new outfit or you -- you see something that caught your eye on TV -- TV is the thing for you -- Uh-huh . -- it 's like , go get it . You do n't got to worry about it for thirty days , you know -- Right . -- and , ah , all of a sudden you just debt , debt , debt , debt , debt and that causes a lot of stress and a lot of anxiety because you like -- -- goh , see , I need to pay my rent , I need to pay my bills , too , so which one do I pay ? So -- Exactly . And like when I think of what I pay out now on the credit cards for the stuff that I 've already used up , or , you know , went to the movies and do n't even remember which one I saw -- Mm . -- you know , stuff like that or went to a restaurant where I did n't need to buy that or this , when I think that I 'm paying now all this money that I could be using doing whatever I want with out of my paycheck -- Mm . -- it kills me . Yes . Especially interest . But I do n't to -- you know , I do n't want to go through the bankruptcy thing like that because that throws ten years of even more hardship on you -- Definitely . -- and why do you have ten years of hardship where I would n't be making my credit better by paying instead of making it worse by throwing a bankruptcy for five years where nothing changes . True . You know , I do n't want to . And no one 's going to touch you after -- for those ten years , no one 's they 's -- they advertise , ah , we ignore bankruptcy , we ignore repossessions , they do n't ignore that . I 've had -- No, they do n't . -- one car -- I 've had one car repo , it 's my first car ever I had -- I was -- I got it like in two thousand and one . I had a nice car , a ninety eight Bueller[ ? ] Sabre and , um -- -- I got it . And did n't know I could n't pay for it . I was working part time and I got a full time job and -- and I thought I could swing it and I did n't think about the -- I -- I -- well , I did include the insurance and all that , but I did n't -- I did n't include the speeding tickets --
CT	That 's good for you . Yeah , just about . Just about . Great . So , you know , I do n't know . I just , um , that 's just mainly the one thing I think is -- and I think a lot of people well , you know , the ones that might not be so happy , you know , with the -- Mhm . -- marr- you know , if they 're in a particular marriage if they 're not really happy . Right . I mean , I- I -- like , there 's people that I 've talked to at work and stuff like that that have gone through divorces or , you know , or having difficulties and stuff and , I do n't meet very many that say that they 'd give their kids back . You know what I mean ? It 's -- I do n't know it just , um , it 's always the guy that can go , you know . Mhm . Mhm . I do n't know . But , um , yeah I think that 's probably what would -- what I would do . Right . Well that -- that sounds -- sounds very -- I think we 're both on , like , the same path . But , you know -- Yeah . I think so to . -- and , ah , and -- So -- so do -- have you recently got remarried ? Ah , in two thousand , this 'll be our third -- Oh you did ? Oh that 's pretty recent . Yeah , yeah . Yeah -- -- so , yes it is . -- oh congratulations to ya . Yeah , it 's really , really nice now and , like I said , we 're all -- you grow up a little bit and , you know , things are a completely different respective now . Yeah . I agree . More settled and everything . So , it -- it feels real comfortable now , you now ? Oh , that 's good . Yeah , it 's go - Yeah , my mum lots of times will say , you know , and my friends , you know , that I now , you know -- Uh-huh . -- " Why do n't you do something about him , you know ? " And I said , " I did n't -- I 've known him for a long time " -- Mhm . -- you know , I had been married a long time . It 's not been the best but , I mean , a - a - a - I would n't get , you know -- Change anything , right ? Yeah . -- chances are I 'm not going to get anybody else , you know -- Right , right , right . -- it 's not like they 're beating down on my door or anything like that . Exact- oh . And , you know how it is ? You just get so used to certain things and that 's the way you so -- it 's easy for you to keep in that -- Exactly . -- in that mode . Mhm . So ... So , I agree . So , that -- I mean , that -- that 's good . I ca n't think of anything else that I would really change and everything worked out for the good anyway . So , you know what I mean ?
CT	Unfortunately , there 's not enough of us to go around , so there -- you know , I mean the -- there 's still quite a bit of work out there . You work full time or ... ? Um , I work for the agency so pretty much full time . I -- what I like about it is I set my own hours . That sounds pretty good . Yeah , and so I call them up and say I can work these weeks and I ca n't work this week or that week because I 'm going to be gone , and so that works really nice . Yeah , there 's flexibility . Yeah -- I guess if you 're in demand you 're -- I really like that -- You can do what you want . You know , it -- as long as I get enough hours in to pay the bills , that 's pretty much it . Y - you could do qualify for retirement that way ? The [inaudible] . Um , there 's not really any retirement -- would 've -- but there 's not too much healt- retirement plans in the healthcare system period . Mm . Um , the benefits are n't really that great unless you get into a really good fulltime job . Um , I 'm going to have to work on that but right now I 'm enjoying the flexibility and being able to go where I want to go and do what I want to do . Sounds like [inaudible ] -- what part of Oregon do you live in ? Um , just outside of Portland . If I -- I suppose you fly[ ? ] into Portland if I visited . Um , it 's left . Out towards the coast . Mm . It 's about , ah , thirty five minutes I 'd say to Portland . Oh , I do n't get too much of that part [several inaudible words ] go over to the west over by , um , West [inaudible ] area . Mhm . Yeah , it 's -- um , oh probably about sixty miles from [inaudible] . You getting a lot of rain ? Yeah . Have been the past few days . Of course we got it really nice for a while but , um , we need it . So , we ca n't complain . Good . And , ah , there 's no -- I -- I just got back from Mexico and coming up through the Ciscues[ ? ] -- there was no snow there . There 's no snow pack at all and it was just kind of really scary . All because you -- not enough rain . If there 's no snow that means there 's no , um , [inaudible ] water in the [several inaudible words ] ? It -- yeah , yeah , it 's just , you know , I mean , ah , i- it - it 's -- it 's scary like it 's going to be a very , very dry , um , summer . We 're going to have another drought situation again . There 's just not going to be enough water unless we get some more snow up there . And fires too , I guess . Yeah .
CT	Not any . Yeah . My husband and I were sitting here the other day and we had this little footstool and all of a sudden , we see these little blue eyes peeking over the footstool -- -- he was pulling , up , you know and -- Oh ! -- it was just -- it looked like , I did it ! Look at me ! Ooh ! Oh my gosh ! So ... . Being a grandparent is something else , let me tell you what . I understand now why they said you would rather have your grandchildren first than kids -- . Because grandkids are -- you 're just so totally different with them . I mean , it 's just -- I 'm just starting to see that , you know . I 'm just -- just starting to see that . Yeah . So ... But no , I would n't trade money for Steph or her kids . Her kids ... she has four children . She has a fourteen year old , a twelve year old , a nine year old and a seven year old . [inaudible ] Yeah . That 's a handful . Yeah , yeah . I ca n't -- I 've now -- I do n't know if anyone asks but I 'd surely take them both ! Yeah . No kidding ! Now , if they wanted to say that , I 'd say , " Yeah " -- -- and I would even share it with Stephanie if I had to do that , you know ? Would n't that be -- you know , that 's -- that 's -- that 's what I 've always thought . If I , you know , won any amount of money , the first -- I mean -- and this sounds awful but I would take care of my friend before -- -- I would take care of my family . Like , she just comes first . Yeah , yeah . She 's just -- Because I know how she struggles , you know -- Yeah . -- she 's just now had to get a job and stuff because they just needed her to work again and uh ... it 's the first time she 's worked ... oh , my gosh ... in probably like , twelve years and so -- That 's exactly where I 'm at . You know , so ... she really could use some . In fact , last night we were talking on the computer and she said , " You know , the lord 's really good because he 's watched over us because .. . " she said , " If I was n't working right now , Jody " she goes , " We just would n't make it " . Yeah And uh , but , you know ... Oh ... So , I know that she needs it as much as ... probably more than I do if you , you know , want to be honest about it , but -- Yeah . -- but uh ... but yeah ... Oh ... this is kind of a unique scenario . Yeah . Okay . Would you take a million -- no , not after even talking to a stranger , I would not take a million dollars . No, it just --
CT	A million dollars ... your best friend . Yeah . Did -- did he say it 's your best friend or just a friend ? Best friend . Oh , really ? Wow . The best friend , you know , the best ? The best friend , that 's what gets you right there . You make tears come to your eyes , your best friend . Mhm . Some people think of their mother as their best friend . You know , or a sister could be sister and best friend . Right . Mm . Mm . I would have to share . Yeah , maybe . But then , like they say , you have to make a choice between one or the other . Right . I see ... I tell ya . But you can always get ano - -- can you always get another best friend or you can always get another million dollars ? . That million dollars only come once . Yeah . Mm ... mm . A million dollars . Mm . Choose the million dollars for a while . Yeah and then -- mhm ... takes the -- yeah , I would -- I think I would have to take the million dollars . Yeah . I still say I have to take the million dollars . Yeah , take the million dollars and get another best friend . Absolutely . I agree . I agree with that . Yeah . Mhm . Well , I guess we made the decision , right ? Yes , we have a decision . Uh-huh . Mhm . Take the million dollars . Yeah . Yeah . That -- that 's a good idea . Mhm . So , do we have to wait 'til the buzzer buzz or does it tell us the ten minutes is up or let 's have a decision ? I do n't know . This is my first time so ... Mine too . Really ? Mhm . Oh . So we are struggling through this . Um ... this ten minutes . I forgot to time it , really . So , it -- When I -- -- d- does that -- we have ten minutes ? Supposed to talk ten minutes . Oh , really ? About -- So , we are supposed to talk about ten minutes for this topic ? Of the topic , uh-huh . Oh . Wow . So , we made a fast decision . A fast decision . Right . But we were still discussing it , you know ? Mhm . Um ... because , you know , it 's hard to turn and lose your best friend . Yeah . And it 's hard to make a decision about losing your best friend in ten minutes . Over a million dollars . Yeah . So ... you know , we 're still deciding which one . We 're still I think I 'd still like to stick with the million dollars .
CT	Mhm . I mean , thinking about uh , you know , how you can live the rest of the life . I mean ... That 's true . ... how old are you ? How old are you now ? That 's true . To have that financial security and it could mean -- Yeah . Financial security -- -- yeah , it could mean more than just uh one friend would to you , you know ? Mhm . That 's true , you know . You can have other friends . Yeah . That 's true . And of course like when you automatically get the money , people au - automatically come to you , I mean , th - that 's the kind of background which I 've come from , like , you know ? Mhm . Whenever you have the money , you always get people around you and they can always [several inaudible words ] ... That 's true . Mhm . ... I mean , you -- you just call a person for a vacation and , you know , you both can get closer and then like , you know , become very good friends even if you lose one friend , like , you know ? You can always go for one more . That 's true , that 's true . how old are you now ? Uh forty four . Forty four ? Mhm . Yeah . See if you get a million dollars you not think about working any more . You can retire -- Oh . -- probably take a voluntary retirement from your job , like , you know ? Yeah . That sounds good . I 'd like that . Yeah and especially when you have kids , like , you know ? You need not worry about anything -- anything about them . Mhm , yeah . That -- that would be a -- a big uh relief , yeah . Yeah . You -- you can send them to the ve- -- I mean , the whichever school they want to , even though -- Mhm . -- accept you for -- for a very expensive school or very expensive college . Mhm . That 's true . Can always send them to ... That 's true . That would , you know , that would be something -- you know , your family is uh ... Mhm . ... is very important to you , you know ? Maybe more important than a friend would be . Yeah and financial security . That -- that 's the keyhole there , I mean , you know ? Mhm , mhm , yes . pro- probably if you are given a chance for that , you want to have a million dollars or do you want to leave your family , then probably taking the family would be better than taking the million dollars . Mhm , yeah . But probably a friend wo n't be that important , I believe ? Yeah , that 's true , yeah . I uh your family would be a little different situation there . You would definitely want to choose your family .
CT	Yeah , you just cannot do it . You cannot , ah -- you 're not supposed to be able to ask religion -- Uh-huh . -- you know , or -- Uh-huh . -- political , ah , beliefs . Mm . That 's , you know , just taboo -- -- you ca n't do it . Okay . But a lot -- [several inaudible words ] . Um , sorry I was just wondering , um , if you might have noticed any patterns , like -- is -- there are these kind of -- if like in a certain industry , like , companies tend to be more prying about personal details , or if like -- or if it 's just kind of random with different companies ? Well , in -- in -- doing the temporary work that I did it was kind of random . It 'd be kind of hit and miss . Okay . Okay . You know , they 'd , ah -- So , there 'd be companies in all different industries that did this -- Yeah . -- it 's not like ... ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , we 'd have , ah , it -- it -- like I say , it seemed like more of the -- the big corporate companies , you know ? Oh . I -- I kind of thought it -- you know , in my way of thinking , of course I might think different than other people -- Mhm . -- I always thought that they had the same that they went by , they wanted certain people in there and certain people not -- Mm . -- it 's -- you know , the feeling that I got . Mm . We had some people from India that interviewed for us one time -- Mhm . -- and they were perf - -- they had the perfect skills for a job , but did n't get it -- Wow . -- because they had another interview with the actual company that was hiring us -- Oh , okay . -- and they did not let them have the job and that kind of made me wonder , you know , " Why , they had the skills " . Yeah . You know ? They had the experience , they had the -- the -- you know , the -- the professional look , attitude -- Mm . -- you know , everything but they did n't get it . And it always -- to this day , it made me wonder . You know , if -- That 's really interesting . Yeah , I -- it -- it -- you know -- and we 've had , ah -- you know , just -- just different people from different areas or walks of life , that did n't get the job that were actually perfect for it . You know ? Wow . And -- Can I -- can I ask just , um , where it was that you had your job ? Like , wh - where these companies were based sort of thing ? Well , ah -- I do n't -- ah , you know .
CT	Exactly . -- it 's just his -- Because it 's masked over nowadays . Yeah , exactly . You know ? It -- there 's some other reason that 's thrown out there . But I think you 're right . In a -- in a large number -- if there 's a large number of employees then it should be implemented . Yeah , I 'm -- I -- I feel like it 's -- it 's probably a valuable thing and I could say in some parts of our -- our United States I do think that there 's still some -- I 'll just say Texas is such a big state -- Mhm . -- um , you know , California , um , the -- the East Coast , um , like I said , I think it 's -- it 's -- it 's become more who -- who -- who has the best qualifications . Right . The states that I 'm most worried about with -- again , are the -- are the Southern states like Georgia and Alabama and -- [inaudible] . -- those kind of states that were so slow to come around to , um , you know , accepting , um , black and , ah -- It 's still bad down there , even nowadays ? Well , not as bad , but I think it still exists -- Yeah . -- to some extent and some of the -- [several inaudible words ] In some of the smaller communities . Right . Right . Um , like I said , I 've no- -- I 've not really visited those areas or I would have first hand knowledge . Um , I 've just gone on vacation [inaudible] . I just know from what I 've read , you know , that every now and then I hear about a -- a little small town in -- um , here or there , um , that -- ah , it 's still having problems with some of that stuff . Yeah . So , ah , I think that 's probably -- and again , you do get the individuals sometimes and , um , certain corporations that that 's just their -- you know , that 's just their flaw . Right . You know , psychologically about feeling , you know , " Oh , this person , you know " -- I mean I think you know , I hate to say male chauvinists but -- They 're there . -- I think -- I think they still exist somewhat . Oh , yeah . Definitely . You know . Well , as for me , I 'm -- I 'm currently looking for a job and I 've been out and I 've seen all different races interview me and I 've -- my last interview with two women . So , I mean , when I look at the work place I see everybody . Yeah , see I 'm looking for a job too . So , um -- and -- and there 's -- you know same here . I think to me I -- I think -- what I 'm more concerned about than -- than percentages of , um , different races and men and women , um , are older people . I think , to me , that 's -- that 's kind of a big problem in our United States right now is that , you know --
CT	-- which you really do n't want your kid to do , but -- and she has , um , Tarzan , which I do n't know why we got that , but she likes it . Um , but the CD ROM games she has are p - -- much better than her Playstation games . They actually teach her , which -- Oh , that 's neat . -- I like much better . Yeah , so they 're more educational than ... Yeah , instead of playing something that 's I guess my grandmother would say warping your mind , but -- -- she does n't play it -- she does n't play it too much , but I much prefer to have her playing educational games , but they do n't have a lot of those for Playstation . Yeah , that 's how -- that 's how -- no , they do n't . That 's how I was when they were younger . We started out with , uh , oh , with the Nintendo and Mario Brothers , but then there was a game that they used to play and it was educational and -- and so that -- it was , um -- ca n't think of the name of it right now . Um , it was -- it was a Mar- -- it was a geography game , but using Mario , and -- Oh , okay . -- so it taught him , you know , a - about just geography in general but made it fun , and so my son at the time was , like , four , I think , when I got him the -- the , uh , Nintendo , and he -- he really liked that game . In fact , he 's seventeen now and last year he -- he was looking for it for the new -- for the newer version computer systems that we have and was able to find it . So , he just said , " That game was just so much fun" . So , I -- I was like that , too , when they were little . And the older they got , the less they were interested in educational games and more -- Yeah . -- about just having fun and playing with their friends . And -- -- I 'll never forget the first time my little one was exposed to some kind of kickboxing or kick fighting or something . I mean , he was only , like , three , and he was playing with a bunch of -- of , uh , neighbors and they were -- it was this game that I would never have allowed him to play , okay , not at that age . Mhm . And I walk in and he was getting into it , you know . I 'm thinking , " Oh , my gosh , what are you doing letting him play this game ? He 's too young" . ' Cause he was really getting into it . And I said , you know , " We do n't need anything to make more violence here " . But he thought it -- Right . So -- but it 's -- we 've always been , um , more protective about what we let them play than --
CT	That 's funny . Long spring break . It was actually one of the better speeches I thought he 'd given , but ... Mhm , yeah , I agree . Definitely . He 's such an interesting public speaker . Yeah . He did n't fumble any words that time , at least . Yeah . Um , let 's see , TV , radio news , phone ... what other ways ? Oh , talking to people . Is there a lot of talk , um , on your campus about the war or protests , anything like that ? Yeah , they had a whole bunch of protests , um , before every -- anything ever happened . Yeah ? Like , there was -- there were , like , every day you would hear people yelling and -- Mm . -- um , I know -- You mean like pro peace or ... ? What ? You mean like pro peace or how did it ... ? Yes , yes . I -- Okay . Yeah , all of 'em were , " We do n't support Bush . We do n't support the war at all " and -- Huh . -- one of the girls I work with , her boyfriend , um , lives in San Francisco and he -- Oh . -- is also a really active -- Uh-oh . Uh -- Has he spent any time in jail lately ? I think he got , like , hurt at one of 'em . I -- something -- Oh , no . He got bashed in the face or I do n't remember , but he -- I 'm sure he wears it with a badge of honor . Yeah . He 's probably proud of it , but keep up on that . She 's really into -- she 's not as much as him , but , um , she tells me , like , all the stuff she 's reading about , and so I keep up on it from her a lot 'cause she 's -- -- and she 's a journalism major , actually , so she 's -- Mm . -- really into it lately . But -- I 'm sure she 's interested in watching how it 's unfolding then , too . Mhm . Yeah . Huh , let 's see . My friends , oh , we just -- we all kind of go , " Yep , it 's happening , but we 're still living our lives " . Yeah . I mean , I guess I 'm married , have kids , and I 've got -- my kids are , um , they 're four and six , so , you know -- Uh-huh . I 've kinda been considering how do you tell them about that ? Yeah . Obviously , you know , they see the news occasionally 'cause it 's breaking into every darned program they could ever imagine watching . Uh-huh . Which I find kind of ironic that , you know , newsbreaks in the kids ' cartoons . Yeah . Let 's see . Who 's watching TV at that time ? Children . So , be sure to , you know , tell them about all the people that 'll be getting killed . Anyway , so that 's kind of an issue .
CT	Wow . He -- he quit but he went to chewing tobacco instead . Well , you know what ? I see a lot of com- commercials -- they have a lot of campaign - campaigns on TV about , um , you know , like , um , like , what -- what can cause , you know , what -- what -- what 's the leading cause of cancer , is from smoking and stuff like that . Have you seen those commercials ? I have . Yeah . And they really talk about , you know , like , um , you know , a lot -- um , a lot of the tobacco companies are saying that , um , like , back in the early sixties that that was the main cause of people catching cancer . And now , like , they did a recent survey with the same company , there 's -- they 're acting like they do n't know what they 're talking about as far as , you know , what they said about twenty years ago about tobacco , you know , is a -- is the main cause of cancer . Have you heard that , um ... ? I heard a little bit of these -- these studies . Yeah . Like , the same ways that you 're -- like , through the TV and -- and through newspaper , and I think that 's good that it 's getting out there and -- Yeah . Because it -- I think a lot of people saw s - smoking as it -- it was n't a very serious thing and -- Mhm . -- and granted it 's not as serious as some of these harder drugs , but I think it needs to be considered . Yeah . I 'm -- I 'm not talking about , like -- Because some of the ingredients they put in cigarettes , you 'd be amazed on what they put in there . I mean , they were naming some of the stuff . I ca n't remember exactly , but they put a lot of harmful stuff in there . I mean , you know ... Well , it sounds -- it 's nasty that people are taking this in . Yeah . Um , yeah , it -- I -- I think through these , uh , through the education people are getting through some of these public advertisements , it will be good . And one thing I 'm glad that they do n't do any more is , like , um , basically market the cigarette brand . Like , I used to see the cigarette brand , like , on , um , like , at the -- at the -- at the gas station and stuff , they used to have , like , the -- the Salem -- um , like , the , um , the billboard or whatever . But I do n't see that any more like I used to , so I think that 's a good thing as well . So , they 're not marketing it like they used to . But now what I 'm noticing is a lot of young teenagers now are smoking . Have you noticed that in Utah ? Um , I have n't noticed it so much in Utah . I 'm also --
CT	Yes , I have . What -- why do you think that 's banned some places ? Um , I was n't aware that it was banned . I know books like , um , Huckleberry Finn or , you know , Mark , ah , you know , books by Mark Twain have been banned before , um -- W- -- why ? -- I think -- I think it 's just because some of the ideas presented at the time were very controversial and , um , you know , they might , I guess some of the ideas are maybe a little bit too -- too liberal for [inaudible ] places , I guess , especially in the South , like the idea of , um , you know , a -- of black people having any kind of , um , any rights [several inaudible words ] of their culture at the time , so because they did n't want -- So , do you think it was -- [several inaudible words ] So , you think it was all right to have them banned ? No, I -- I do n't , but I 'm just trying to , ah , you know , offer a reason as to why they might have been banned at the time , I do n't agree with them being banned at all . Oh , good . Because I do n't -- I do n't , you know , I 'm -- I 'm a big Mark Twain fan , actually , I 've been through Hannibal quite a few times and -- and I -- I just do n't understand why -- it sounds li- -- it sounds like politically correctness to me -- political correctness . Yeah . Definitely . I think people are just kind of scared also if anything challenges their belief system , if you live in a stable community where everybody kind of things the same , anything that might change that is a threat , you know . So , um , that would be an unwelcome kind of thing if you 're happy with your current situation , you -- you would n't welcome any kind of change . Yeah , but I -- I do n't know that I agree with that . I think changes are -- at least , a -- the -- the accessibility to change should -- should be looked at positively by everybody . I agree . I mean , I think change is very healthy and I think that to be settled into one kind of mindset is very , you know , it 's in a way , um , you know , people are kind of ignorant if they 're so narrow minded , so I think that change is good and , um , you know , they should welcome any kind of different viewpoint , but unfortunately a lot of people , um , do n't have that kind of mindset , you know -- Well , you know -- -- anybody who thinks differently than they do , um , they just want to get rid of or silence . I find it interesting that you began by -- by saying that you were a liberal and -- and this way and -- and I do n't think of myself as a liberal , but I am listening to you and -- and talking to you and you to me and -- and it seems like we both agree on a lot of things and yet we --
CT	And I think people , they were saying some of the neighbors were -- Yeah . -- upset that she would do that . Yeah , yeah . I can see that . I -- Yeah . But it was funny , where -- where I was living in -- in Houston , that s where I grew up . Mhm . The people were kinda the same way . They said ,  I just cant believe that person is a -- is a , uh , actress ! You know ? Right . And you -- youre like , going , Wow !  Kinda like your Harry Potter comment . Right . Right . You know , why would you do it , or whatever ? No, were very , very conservative here . When I first came up here to go to college , because I was raised in florida , um , I could nt believe , um , you know , how conservative it was around here . N- and -- and nothing was open on Sunday , and people just did the whole , you know , they stayed home on Sunday . Yeah . It -- did you hear a beep ? Uh  I heard like , a little beep , I hope it s not my battery in my phone ! I did nt , and mine was starting to warble , uh , were new to cellphones -- Im talking on a cellphone -- Uh-huh . -- and it s -- it just drives me nuts . Does it ? I just think it should be like the regular phone and -- Right . -- work all the time and stuff . And plus you can be places and it just quits . Oh God ! And youre going like , you know , so anyway , that s something . But I dont think it was mine , it couldve been your battery . It couldve been because this is the phone that is hooked up to my computer , so I dont use it that much . That -- that s the bane of our existence , all the batteries running down in -- I know ! -- in phones . Its just -- it s literally stupid . I know , it is , youre right . Well , how do you like this -- so I -- Im one of the few people in the world who does nt have a cellphone because I really dont want anyone calling me right now ! Well , I -- Im with you . And it s kinda dumb because my girlfriend got one . Yeah . Uh , shes starting -- she started working kind of across town and she does nt like to ever running out of gas or whatever . Mhm . Well , so then , it was -- -- Okay and it was kinda neat to call her if she was at the store or something . Well then , we had Verizon , it was twenty bucks more and they gave you a free phone . Twenty bucks more a month .
CT	Yeah . Like , I think some schools banned that because , you know , they felt like there were some violent outbreaks or whatever at -- at certain schools related to that , um , so I mean , yeah . Like , I -- you know , it 's easy to say you 're , ah , you can just have an open society and stuff like that , but then when you have books that , you know , that instruct people how to make bombs or -- Yeah . -- you know , things like that , you have to draw a line somewhere , too . Um , which is , you know , more of a general censorship kind of thing than just in schools and what students should be allowed to read , so ... I mean , in an ideal world there should be free speech whatsoever , but -- R- -- yeah . But considering we 're not perfect human beings , there should be restrictions . Yeah . I -- I 'm just curious as to how , uh , how it 's decided , you know , in communities what books are able to be read by students and which ones are n't , or which , you know , are on the reading lists of assigned books if you -- if you have a summer off -- Yeah . -- you know , what -- what books make it on the summer reading list ... um , you know , if it is in fact a community kind of decision , you know , like in Kentucky or wherever , you 're talking about , you know , if the members of whatever committee , and I guess it 's a committee , you know , that decides this kind of decision . Maybe it 's just , you know , the superintendent of schools , I really do n't know , um , you know , how are the people who make that decision elected or , you know , appointed or whatever and it probably varies from place to place . I also think there should be options available . I mean , if you are objecting to a certain book , then you should be able to read another book of equal literary merit . Mhm . But I do n't know how practical that is , considering public education and its current status . Yeah . I mean , yeah , of course , and just the availability of books probably . Yeah . So , mm . Yeah , if you -- if you make , uh , every book or s - several books available , you 're going to have to buy , you know , a different copy , many copies of different books . Mhm . So ... mm . I mean , I get into arguments like this all the time , like free speech , flag burning -- Ahah . -- like the Nazi parade -- Ahah . -- stuff like that . You get what , email ? No, I get like arguments -- Oh , arguments . -- with , like , random people . Oh . Really ? Yeah . Oh , okay . Um , I do n't really , uh , get into arguments about it with people , but I guess I 'm not , uh , that -- that vocal about things either . I mean , you know , I do n't -- I do n't think like the -- the KKK should have , you know , like free speech rights or anything , um , --
CT	Yes . And teach them right from wrong from day one . I think so too . I just -- I just think that as long as -- as you have people out there that want to take away your rights as a parent , I think that the parents should decide . I think as long as parents are involved then the kids will probably work out right . But if they 're not involved then the kids are gonna go wrong anyway . Right , they 're left on their own -- Yes . -- to do whatever . Yeah . And that 's where you have kids get involved in pornography . Yes , drugs , pornography , all the other bad things . Right . Instead of sex ed - sex education they 're getting into pornography and they 're not learning -- Yeah . -- the right thing . Th- they 're not learning the right stuff . I mean , my -- I was a foster parent and I had a twelve year old come in and tell my children , with very bad language , just what had happened to her in her household , why she was taken out . Oh goodness . And I 'm sitting there , I says -- and they says , you know , my daughter comes out with a string of foul language and says , " Is this what really happens ? " I says , " Well " I says , " Number one , we do n't use that kind of language to describe anything" . I says , " And number two , that should only happen between a - grown ups , it should never happen between an adult and a child " . Right . I says , " Now " and I sat her down and told her all the right stuff and then told her all the stuff th - that was n't supposed to go on and then , you know , and , you know , she was -- she was only like , six . And , I mean , you really do n't -- Goodness . -- expect to have a six year old learning this stuff from a twelve year old that should n't have known it in the first place . Right . And , uh , I 'm sitting there and then I says , " Well " I says , " You know " I says , " Bad things happened to her " . I says , " This is not her fault , this -- bad things happened to her , but she 's got --" you know , I told her that , you know , I took the other child apar- apart and told her that this was not an appropriate thing for her to be saying . Uh , that if she wanted to talk about that maybe she 'd better talk to me first so that we could tell -- find out what she could say to the other kids because they were n't as old as she was . Right . And that -- that way , you know , everybody was kind of -- kind of satisfied that way . Because she wanted to get -- get -- get it out , but she -- I had to -- had to limit what she was saying and how she was saying it , because it was appropriate for her to get it out .
CT	Many years ago and I just never could get into that . I just could n't get the least bit excited about that . I wa - -- exercise just does not excite me at all . Yeah . It never has . Yeah , it 's -- you know , it 's kinda boring . I -- I had tried the , um , the gym like the machines and stuff -- Yeah . -- and it 's just like so boring . Yeah . I -- I tried that many , many , many years ago and I just -- it 's just not my cup of -- the only thing I really enjoyed about that was going in the , uh , uh , sauna and -- Oh yeah . -- um , and I did enjoy that part of it . Yeah , I really miss that . It -- The things that do n't require movement , you know . You just sit there . See I like that 'cause you go in there and then you look like you 've been exercising 'cause you 're all sweaty and , you know , like -- Right , right . -- yeah . Now I like that part of it . I sound like I am really -- I 'm really not nearly as lazy as I sound like . Oh no , no but I know exactly -- I mean and , you know , it 's -- it 's hard especially , you know , as you get older it 's like the less -- less you wanna go . Right . And , you know -- I do n't know , it 's -- I ca n't imagine -- I mean , sometimes it 's like I 'm only thirty and I -- sometimes I find it like really a struggle to get going so I 'm like , " Oh , when I get a little older " like when I hit forty or fifty I wonder , you know , how I 'm gonna be able to pull it off . Well , I think , a lot -- a lot depends on how much you like it when you 're younger . Mhm . And how much you participate . Yeah . And , uh , if you 're not really into it you 'll wake up one morning when you 're fifty five or so and you 'll see all your sagging parts . I 'm starting to see that actually already . It 's kinda sad . I do n't know what happened but -- Well , let me tell you , it gets worse . Somewhere around thirty it is , as soon as I hit thirty I woke up and I thought , " Boy , this changed " . This was n't like this before . How exactly -- Well , it only gets worse unless you do something about it . Yeah , yeah . It 's I guess like -- it 's funny 'cause the Taekwando takes care of some of it but like I remember when I was a kid people used to make fun of the teachers 'cause the arms -- underneath the arms --
CT	it 's very dangerous . Yes . But the police picked him up for whatever charge -- I do n't know I did n't follow up with it but -- -- it just makes you feel like here in your country where you have the freedom to do all these wonderful freedoms that you have , it does n't seem like you have any freedom whatsoever . Mm . And that 's frightening . It is . That 's really frightening . On- -- one of the things is I -- I did a lot of world travel before September eleventh and , um , when I had a vacation , um , since then I -- I said , " I 'm not going anywhere but to see the United States . I wanna see some place here that I have n't seen " . Right . And I went out to , um , out to the , um , the Midwest and drove through Minnesota and South Dakota and took a couple of weeks out there and , uh , you know , I was looking at Oklahoma too , just saying , " I wanna see some -- a lot of nothing" . And Oklahoma 's the place to go . South Dakota was too . I was amazed , you know , it took me all day to drive across the state . It 's so flat here . And it 's -- But -- And are you pretty far out in the country ? No. I actually -- I live next to Fortsome[ ? ] Military Base . Oh yeah , wild . So , you do have a military connection of -- of some sort then ? Right . And when they buckled down after September eleventh they totally closed -- Yeah , you could n't get on the base . Right . Right . Which , on one level having kids and being involved in soccer that 's where our soccer games were held was on their polo field . Mhm . So , our city people were scrambling around trying to find some place to put eight thousand people for soccer games and that was , for my kids , that they -- you know , they could n't understand about a terrorist attack but they knew their soccer had been disputed and , you know , " Oh my gosh we 're right here next to this military base and it 's an artillery base at that " and when they start doing their exercises with , uh , the Enola S system that they have -- Yes , mhm . -- it sounds like World War Three around here . Sure , sure . Well , obviously you 're near a range , you can hear some of the hundred and five millimeters and things like that going off ? I 've actually had pictures fall off my wall from the vibrations . Wow ! It 's that close . Now , are you -- are you married to someone in the military ? No. My stepdad was military and I have a brother in law that 's military and we have several friends , of course , being next to a military base but , no , he 's , uh , into plumbing , which pays better than the military around here , so ...
CT	I turned mine in I gave it up , I did n't use it . Yeah , I need mine for the kids , you know . See , yeah , I think that 's the difference in our focuses . Yeah . I think that 's it right there . Because of the kids , right . Oh . And you 're probably younger than I am . I do n't know . Well , I 'm -- I 'm in my fifties . Yeah , I 'm in my thirties . So , there 's -- there 's a different focus right there . Yeah , that 's right . Um -- And -- I -- I 'll tell ya I had a , um -- my -- my first cousin and his son both worked at the World Trade Center . Oh my gosh ! And , uh , that day it was all I could do to keep from calling my aunt to find out what was going on with them . They were n't -- tell me they were n't there . Well , I cal- -- I finally -- I got to six o'clock in the afternoon and then I just had to call 'cause nobody called me and I had to know . Come to find out my cousin had -- his office had move , uh , I think , six months prior to that and was no longer in the World Trade Center -- Good . -- and his son worked on the eighty fourth floor , do n't ask me which Tower I do n't know , um , had a day off that day . Wow , that -- you 're family was lucky . Oh , very lucky . Yeah . Very , very lucky . That kid got himself a new birthday as far as I 'm concerned and it 's September eleventh . Yeah . Right . Um , but , you know , that 's how close it got to us . Yeah , that 's very close . And I still -- I still do n't think that we 've done big changes in -- in anything that we do . Oh . There 's things that I would never had done -- I do n't think even before September eleventh I would have been too infatuated with a trip to , uh , Egypt or Israel , you know , or -- Yeah . -- [inaudible ] world I -- I -- Yeah , well , you know , we 're not in a position where we could take those trips right now but -- Well , I -- my premise was if somebody gave it to me I would n't take it . Yeah , that 's how -- mine too . If somebody gave it to me I would n't take it now . I probably would have then maybe though . Really ? Yeah . Now , see that 's -- that 's -- we 're different again . I would have gone to Israel then but -- Uh , they 're -- they 're places I 'd love to see but they 're not top on my list , you know . Yeah , yeah . But I do n't think that has anything to do with September eleventh . Um , fascinating , is n't it ? What do your kids say ?
CT	And I think that the more you think about it , uh , the more you realize that -- that you need to help -- to help us , uh -- Right . -- in this country , uh -- Mhm . -- help them , uh , get to school and so forth . Right . Uh-huh . Yes . I -- I have changed , uh , since nine eleven and -- and I hope that , uh , I 'll continue to -- Oh , yeah . Mhm . -- to change more . I -- I have an -- an -- and I can see that it definitely was for the best . Yes . And , uh , I mean , I 've -- you know , I mean , I 've always been a caring person , but I 've -- Yes . I try to care more -- Yes . -- than others -- But -- but now it 's -- -- than myself . -- it 's really , uh , you -- you 've really , uh , been -- been awakened , so to speak , more , uh , even though you did care in the past and -- Mhm . -- and I have , uh , cared in the past , too , but um , I just never realized until nine eleven that people could , uh , feel so strongly a - against other people , that they would be willing to sacrifice themselves and other people to -- to take down the United States . Mhm . Yeah , yeah . And that -- and we -- we need to maybe show others that we are more caring and we -- and , uh , and we do think of other people . I know they think that we -- all we care about is oil and -- Right . Right . -- and big houses and everything . Right . Uh-huh . But , uh , that is n't true at all because -- No, that 's definitely not true . -- I think the -- I think the average person , uh , does think more , uh , of -- of other people than -- than we 're given credit for . Right . I -- I definitely believe I agree with that . I definitely agree with that . Uh-huh . Yeah , and , uh , I -- I -- I think , uh , really , al- although we still hearing things in , uh , problems in the school system -- Yes . -- I think that , uh , it 's gotten better . Yes , I think -- Yeah -- -- that it has . Mhm . I -- I think in -- in Durham , things have gotten better . Um , I 'd been away for a long time and I decided to come back and I 'm happy , uh , that , uh , things have gotten better in many ways . I live in a -- a multi racial community and -- Mhm . -- I 'm glad that I do , uh , because of what I believe in and I think that the schools have become more multi rational -- racial --
CT	-- out of those windows were on fire , and -- Oh . -- it was just devastating . To see another human being on fire , and then the people she knew that she worked with were in those buildings . Like I said we 're Jehovah 's Witnesses , so we knew that there were other members of our religious affiliation there , and it was just so traumatic . It was so traumatic . Oh , my heart goes out to her . I 'll never take public transportation in any form . Ever . Well you know what , I was always afraid of flying because I -- I was , like , -- I never even thought of terrorists . I was just afraid of flying because there 's no , like , air patrol . In the event that the plane goes down , you 're going down . Thank you , that 's what I always said -- But , you know -- -- you 're going down . I mean , if you 're in a car accident , of course somebody could come and help you out , whether they 're , you know , with the police , the fire -- a -- a citizen could come and help you out -- That 's what I always said , -- -- but a plane -- -- " If I break down , I can walk" . Right . But , you know , a plane is something different , but in light of what has happened September eleventh , it 's like , you do n't even know what to expect -- forget the plane falling down , you gotta worry about somebody 's gonna , you know , threaten your life . Absolutely . So... I know that I 'll never take public transportation , so travelling for me is out . Mhm . Um , -- And it does n't hurt my feelings , I 'd rather stay home and be safe . Mhm . Um , ... Or walk or get in your own car . I figure with my luck I 'd be on the plane that they terrorized . Exactly , right . Yes . Oh , my . That 's just such an awful thing . I was kind of , um , pleased though , um , last year , when that time came they did n't -- like , ... Sometimes a person could be in a process of healing , and then -- I thought maybe they were gonna overdo it and just replay all of the devastating scenes over and over again , and that would just hurt all the grieving families , but I think they were a bit more considerate . Up here -- and see up here , we saw it different . I 'm from Maine -- Oh , okay . -- well , I 'm from New Hampshire , but I live in Maine . Okay , okay . And um , we really felt that they overkilled it up here . Okay , okay . We were all complaining up here , enough , enough already . Oh , right , right . You know , you ca n't look at the little kids crying anymore , you ca n't look at the parents crying anymore , how -- you know , it was just awful . Day after day , all day long .
CT	-- three countries that were -- Yeah . -- really involved . There was n't just the American people there . Right . Right . And one of the -- yeah . One of the things I remember thinking is 'cause -- 'cause of the basis for that , it 's just the -- the strong hatred of , like , America -- Americanism and American people , and almost just wanting to , like -- they want to just , like , destroy as many as they can . And I remember one of the things I 'm thinking is , um , like , here at college , like , uh , I 'm at -- I 'm at the University of Wisconsin , which is like -- Mhm . -- a very big university , and -- Mhm . -- when we go to -- um , like , I just remember right after September eleventh going to college football games , and security was way step -- way -- you know , it 's very stepped up . Mhm . But just thinking about if they really -- it 's -- it 's just -- it was such a scary thought , because especially really , we 're just so -- you know , hated Americans so much that they just wanted to kill as many as possible . Mm . Uh , there 's no -- there 's no , like , area where there 's more people in a small area than at a college football game . Mm . I mean , that when that stadium fills up , you 've got eighty thousand people sitting in there , so there was -- I def - I def - I remember the first -- they cancelled the -- our game right after September eleventh and then -- Oh , they did ? -- I remem - yeah . And then I remember the next one after that , security was very stepped up , but I know everyone was , you know , a little bit anxious going through it , but you know , you go on with your daily life and things got back to normal . Yeah , that 's -- that 's true . Uh , we -- Yeah . We have a very resil- resilient culture . Yeah . Yeah . Yes , however -- however I say that . Anyway , that we can bounce back and -- Right . -- that 's the thing and , uh -- Yeah . But m - um , my travel plans have not changed -- Right . -- and things like that , that people say , well it was -- affected this , this , this and this . Right . And , really , I 've gone on with my life and my -- Right . -- plans and what I should , you know , do ? Yep. I might think about a little bit , okay , now what if I was cut off with my water and my -- Yeah . -- food , so I kinda planned a little bit about that . Uh-huh . I do n't think that the terrorist is biological things . Like , I have n't done anything -- Uh-huh .
CT	Mhm . You know ? H- h - he got -- he has a doctorate degree and , um , he 'll probably stay here , where he 's -- where he 's at . Mhm . And so I have to always travel a long distance -- I 'm twelve hundred miles from where I grew up . Oh my ! So -- I grew up in Wyoming . And I -- North western Wyoming . And I think it 's hard just being two hours away , 'cause my family is really close -- Oh , I know that -- -- and there 's eleven of us , so I would love to live two hours from family -- -- that would be wonderful . Yeah . And so , you know , I 'm the only one -- well , myself and I 've got two other , um , siblings that do n't live there , but all the rest of 'em , you know , they -- well , I 'll go home and they 're always doing something together , you know , bringing all of their families . And so you -- you miss that . I miss that aspect of it . And -- and not being readily accessible and them not being readily accessible to me . Yeah . One -- one great thing is , our family reunions on both sides are usually in the same state . Oh . And lots of times we can coordinate 'em and because of where they , um , where relatives live and everything , when we go on our trips , we can usually see family on -- on my husband 's side and my side , and two different years we were able to do two family reunions , one on his side and one on my side , the same , um , week . That 's great . And it worked out . And -- and this year we 're doing the same thing , we 're going to a camping reunion up in Utah -- Mhm . -- in the beautiful mountains up there . And -- and then we 've got my mother 's seventieth birthday re - um , party . [inaudible] . And it 's actually -- the r- the day we stop the reunion we start the party for my mother ! Oh , cool . So we 're doing it all -- and it 's about the same area . Cool . And it 's usually kind of a central area to -- Mhm . -- but we have to drive , oh , you know , five hundred -- about five hundred , six -- six hundred miles , to get up there . But my mother lives , um , four hundred miles away , so we usually stay with her -- Wow . -- even if we 're going up to the reunions on the -- my husband 's -- Mhm . -- side of the family . Mhm . And we 're [several inaudible words ] so , my husband gets twenty one days off but he does n't usually take that many -- Oh . -- he ca n't afford to take that many .
CT	Yeah , okay . -- and it was just me and my son . And we were constantly out . Yeah . So , what kind of changes did you make ? Probably the biggest change was , I watched a lot of news ! Did you watch ? See , now , I could n't watch it . Yeah , yeah , I did . I -- I watched a lotta news . I had the TV on when it happened , when the first plane hit the tower . Yeah . I had it o - -- had the TV on and thinking , " Oh , what a horrible accident " and then they sh - -- had -- they showed live the next plane hitting and it was like , you knew that right away it was n't an accident . Right , as soon as -- and I remember -- And then when it hit the Pentagon and then when it crashed here in Pennsylvania , I was just -- You were like , yeah . -- glued to the TV to see what was gonna happen next , and -- Well , 'cause I was in Chic-- I live in Chicago , you know -- Mhm . and I live pretty close to downtown . Not -- I mean , not too far , probably about ten miles away from downtown . Okay . And I remember people , when it first happened , one of the parents had walked in -- I was working and one of the parents had walked in and said , " Oh my God , look what just happened on TV" . I 'm like , " Okay" . Yeah . I turned on the t- we all turned on the TV -- Mhm . -- we put it in the hallway . As soon as we turned on the TV they were broadcasting and the second plane hit . The second one . And then , like , and then the third one and the fourth one and everything , and all of a sudden -- Yeah . -- someone said -- someone -- " A plane 's coming to Chicago " -- Oh . -- and that 's all you heard . Mhm . You know , the radio was broadcasting that there was a plane that 's -- a plane that was coming into Chicago -- Yeah . -- and it was , you know , it was bound for downtown and it 's been hijacked . Yeah . And that 's all we heard . Yeah . And then of course , you know , you had -- a - a - all day long it was , you know , they evacuated the Sears Tower , they -- Yeah . -- did all this . Yeah . I mean , I could n't watch it 'cause I had children to , you know , to watch . But , yeah , I did n't -- I did n't watch much TV . Yeah . I was like , no , no , no , no . I mean , I lost like , twenty five pounds . Oh , did you really ? It -- oh , it was horrible . Yeah .
CT	You know it -- I ca n't say that I do anything different , uh , as -- Yeah , me neither , 'cause I -- I feel like , you know , why -- I 'm gonna be start looking at people and , uh , and saying , " Well , you 're from there , so I guess --" Yeah . "-- you may be .. . " I 'm like , you know , you do n't know . Yeah . You do n't know who will be the person that come after you . Right . And I think that it 's -- when it 's your time to go , it 's your time to go . Yeah . It does n't matter . You know . So just live your life as it is , uh , as full as you can -- Yeah . -- right now . And instead of just watching TV and then kinda , " Okay , today I 'm gonna do this because --" Mhm . "-- it seems like , you know" . It 's like when they have these like , high alerts over the United States , you know ? Yeah . Over here in Washington they 're like , wow , they have -- Yeah . -- you know , you ca n't go to the station , you know , because they 're gonna do -- they may do this . I 'm like , " Come on , I cannot just , you know --" Yeah . "-- not [inaudible ] " -- And I -- I think that -- that is about the only thing that , you know , unfortunately I hear you say that , I think that 's about the only thing that I have changed , is raising a eyebrow at , uh , those that look like they might be from that , uh , um , country , uh , like this -- I hope that 's nobody buzzing in my [inaudible] . Uh-huh . Um , uh , but that 's about the only thing that it has done , is raise that eyebrow . And I do n't like that , so , uh , because I do n't want to prejudge people , because I have friends -- Mhm . -- that are from diff - -- that are from different countries and so forth and -- and I 've worked with , uh , international students a long time , and , you know , I just -- I just -- just do n't think that you should look at everybody just because they 're not white , " Oh , well , that must be --" Yeah . "-- uh , uh , they 're -- they 're a suspect " you know ? Yeah . Or just br- -- just because they look like they 're from there , oh , they 're a suspect . Yeah . You know ? And -- Yes . Y - you do n't know -- But -- -- you know ? It 's too -- it 's too broad of a -- it 's too broad of a thing to do , so I think basically what we 've done is just that , you know , we 're just not gonna go thinking that way , you know ? Yeah . We 're just gonna continue to live our lives as we 've been .
CT	You know . And so they 're -- they do n't listen to -- -- what 's being said to them . I think that 's true . As I get older too , I have more trouble , um , focusing , because I have to kinda think of what I 'm gonna say -- Yeah . -- because , um , otherwise I forget what the whole topic was ! Yeah , well I usually kinda -- kinda multi task when it comes to that , you 've gotta be listening -- Exactly . -- and then thinking about what you 're gonna say at the same time . Exactly . Yeah . I know when my kids were your kids ' age , I -- that 's what -- you know , I knew who closed the door , I was n't in the room -- Mhm . -- but I knew it . Mhm . And I knew who was over there making that noise and I knew somebody was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich -- Yeah . -- and all those things . And my husband could never understand because he -- How you -- -- was n't that way . Yeah . He could sit there and tune everybody out -- Yeah . -- and focus on whatever he wanted to do . Mhm . I never have been able to do that . Yeah , I know what you 're saying . Have you ? No. Um , not usually . You ca n't really distance yourself from -- Uh-uh . -- the home that you 're supposed to be the h - -- the homemaker or whatever in . Yeah . I guess men can -- or for the most part they can disengage because that 's just not their role , I guess , you know ? Yeah . Where women , you know , you ca n't just -- you ca n't just turn that part of y- off it when it comes five o'clock or something . Right . It just keeps on going and going ! Well , we 've got that brain that -- Yeah . -- connects , and they 've got the one that 's more one sided . Yeah , that 's true . So ... But -- We 'll just bash men during this conversation -- Oh , the -- -- we wo n't even ... Oh , let 's not do that . But -- but it 's true , I mean , they do -- they are able to focus more , um -- Yeah . -- and tune out stuff . Yeah . But , uh ... Well , if we did n't change too much since nine one one , then , um , do we know anybody that did ? Um ... I do n't think so , I mean , I really [inaudible ] -- I do . Oh , do you ? Okay . My b - -- my brother , who still lives in North Dakota -- Uh-huh . -- went out and bought two gas masks for he and his wife --
CT	Right . I hope that does n't happen here . But ... Yeah . Now , have -- ah , how is your football team there ? Do they have very high salaries ? I guess I do n't know a lot about them . I mean , like , the Cowboys are like the highest grossing team in the United States right now . Oh , my gosh , wow . There 's just -- they 're supposed to get like a hundred and seventy five million , I think , a season . Oh , my goodness . On revenues , that 's crazy . Wow , wow , that 's a lot . Well , we 're going through the -- they want a new stadium here , both the football and , and the Twins . Oh , that 's cool . But -- and now , you know with the war and the economy , we do n't hear so much about it anymore , so -- Right , yeah . Maybe they 're gonna put it on the back burner , but people just ca n't seem to afford that either , we 're paying the players so much money , and -- Right . -- nobody wants their taxes to go up . Right . So , well at least you and I both agree . Yeah . I do n't know if that 's good or not , or if it 's better to have somebody to debate -- debate with . Yeah , yeah . I mean , I do n't know what the other side of the topic could be , because , you know -- Well , I do n't , I do n't either . I mean , if -- you know , unless you 're one of the , one of the players . Yeah . ' Cause , I , I would imagine the owners are n't very happy when they go on strike either , to -- you know -- Right . -- to talk about it or threaten it . It 's -- it does n't do them any good either , they 're trying to make money , I 'm sure . Yeah . We have a Texan that owns our Vikings here , McCombs . Yeah . So , I do n't know if he 's gonna keep them here or not , but when they argue about they pay , sometimes I think people just say , well , go some place else , and -- you know . Yeah . If that 's the way you feel . But they just ca n't seem to be satisfied for some reason or other . Yeah . It just comes down to greed . Yeah , I think you 're right . I think that 's true . Although some of them , I guess -- I , I , I guess some do a lot for different charities and so forth . But -- Right . -- maybe we do n't always hear about that . Yeah . And I 'm sure when there 's a strike , there 's some of them that do n't -- do n't want to strike . Yeah , they just wanna play . Yep. So , those are the ones I feel bad for . Look , we watch , we watch a lot of sports , so we feel bad when they are n't on .
CT	And they 're running around screaming , " I do n't make enough money so I 'm not gonna play until you give me more " . Yeah . And they 'll always get more money 'cause it 's -- Right . -- it 's -- ' Cause they ca n't afford to not have them play . Right , it 's a multi million dollar industry . But -- right . And , I think , education should be -- Number one . Right . I agree . The- they 're trying to pass a lottery here in Oklahoma so that more money can go towards funding education and there are a lot people opposing it and , you know , I 'm one of those that will say , " Well , our taxpayers will just keep going to Texas or Kansas or Louisiana --" Mhm . -- or whatever to spend their money instead of putting it back into the state . Mhm . So , they 're trying to make it to where anything generated by the lottery will go directly to education . Yeah . I think that 'll help to a point . Yeah , and I remember when lottery started that 's what it was meant for , like , the percentage of it was supposed to go towards education but I remember seeing , I do n't know if it 's still like that , but I know a lot people were n't -- a lot of people in the education field were n't even seeing that money even though it was supposedly made for that purpose . Right . But -- See that 's the one and only purpose they 're wanting it here -- Yeah . -- and you figure , you know , the athletes they 've got a better shot at hitting the millions by joining up in college or high school or whatever -- Yeah . -- hoping to get a pro career -- Right . -- than any one person does hitting it in the lottery . I agree . I agree with you totally . And unfortunately the United States do n't have a whole lot doing the soccer and that 's the biggest sport we have in this area of Oklahoma . Yeah . That 's soccer . Soccer ? Mhm . Well , we 've got the Mavericks , we 've got the Cowboys , we 've got the Stars , we 've got , like , you know , a good amount of people but , you know , still I do n't hear anything extraordinary about these people that , you know , about the amounts of money they 're giving to charity or the amounts of money they 're giving towards education -- Mhm . -- or anything . Nope , not at all . Yeah . And I think it 's absolutely ridiculous . I agree . I think too it 's going to be real controversial . Yeah . The subject they 're putting out because they 're gonna find some big football players somewhere that 's just gonna go nuts and -- Yeah , and really sports is not a necessary -- you know , the sports industry , is not really a necessary industry , you know , like --
CT	And I 'm going where did he get that from , where did he get that from ? And my daughter was like , " Well , Mom , I guess she -- he got it 'cause we always say let 's got to grandma 's house " . That 's -- so , you see , you 're grandma 's house , right ? I 'm Grandma House . Hi , Grandma 's house . Yes , but it 's so sweet to hear him call me that . I feel like , " Okay" . Mm , mm . Yeah . Do you have kids . Oh , yeah . Mine are -- are eight and ten so they 're kinda of in that getting older stage , two girls . Oh , good , good , good . Yeah . My younger one -- you talk about what they call they 're grandmas , my younger one calls her -- her grandmother , Gram Cracker -- -- because -- because when we went over there , uh , my mother always used to give them chocolate gram crackers , right ? Okay , okay . So , she just started calling her Gram Cracker and it stuck . I mean she still calls her Gram Cracker . How cute . Is n't that funny ? Yeah . That is so funny . I tell you -- Kids are -- kids are cute though . And her grandmother just loves to hear her called that . Oh , yeah . Oh yeah . That 's so cute . But my two -- let me see , mine -- like I say mine is pretty grown -- they grown -- pretty grown but they 're like twenty four -- Yeah . -- and twenty one . Uh-huh . So , that 's pretty old . Yeah . Mhm , one in college and one married and , like I say , got the two grandkids . How nice though , yeah . Mm . At least you 've gotten through all those teen years , huh ? I -- I have that -- -- to look forward to right now . You 've got something to look forward to . Oh , yeah . Just -- just pray a lot . Just pray . Yes , I do a lot of that . Just pray , just put God first , please . That -- that 's right , that 's what we do . Yes , yes , yes and it will get you through 'cause I tell you each one of them gonna go through it four years at a time . Mm . And it seems like you start when you 're twelve and it ends when they 're like eighteen . Uh-huh . Well , that would n't be too bad , if I could be sure that it was gonna end at some point , you know . And -- It 's gonna end at eighteen . -- and everything was gonna turn around and -- Uh-huh . -- everybody would be okay . I think that 's what you worry about . Mhm . That they 're not going to be okay when it 's all done with , you know .
CT	Yeah . Because they did n't have what they thought they had . They did n't have what it took . That 's right . Well , you know ? Or the ones that get into professional sports and , you know , can only play -- or because they get hurt . Mhm . You know ? And it 's like what were they-- And that 's another thing , they get , uh , all the -- the top doctors and -- and , oh , you know , um , you know , bone and -- Right . -- um , um , even the exercise equipment and everything that they , uh , the techniques that they use and all are the top -- Mhm . -- I mean , it 's not , you know , what the ordinary person can get . Right . Right . You know ? Yeah . Which is wrong . I mean , I think it should be to the -- everyone , not just -- Sure . Sure . -- the elite . Should n't be catered to just because you 're an athlete . Yeah . You know ? No matter how good you are . Yeah . Or , um , uh , I know we had a couple of 'em that , uh , had incidents down here at , you know , like bars at the -- down in Orlando -- Oh , ab - -- yeah . -- and things of that sort and , uh , it was kind of covered over , but yet it was n't covered over , you know ? Mhm . They , uh , let enough out to satisfy -- Yeah . -- that they did something wrong , but it was n't , you know -- and then it was , oh , well , it was n't that bad . It -- it was n't that bad , yeah . Yeah . And that 's , you know ... I think the -- the perks are too much for the -- what they do . Yeah , I -- I agree . And I think given the right to strike -- Yeah , I agree . I agree . You know , I mean , yes , you need to be -- maybe they need to unionize , you know , as -- as players they need to unionize to be able to have a say in what the owners can do and a say -- Yeah . -- in what the management can do , and what their agents can do . Mhm . You know ? So , yeah , I agree with that as a collective bargaining agent , yeah , they should be able to do something like that . But to be able to walk out when your job is -- They 've gotten -- -- to provide a service for the fans -- Yeah . You know ? And they 're -- they 're actually walking out on the fans themselves -- Yeah . -- instead of the -- the owners . Yeah . ' Cause , uh , I mean , the owners do n't -- they do n't do nothing . If they do strike they do n't do anything but raise ticket prices to --
CT	Because you do n't hear of any Michael Jordans or Tiger Woods or anybody like that complaining . No, they do n't because they 're good . And they 're the true stars . Right , right . You see them , the newspapers have them . It 's all over the internet but some no name new guy will be the first one to stand up and say , " Well , this is n't fair " . Right . " I need more , I want more " . For doing nothing . Right . Has n't hit a ball all season , has n't caught anything all season , has not made a play all season and also , though , something else , it is a season . It 's not a year time -- a -- a full-time job . Right . They perform during I think two months out of the year , the rest are in some kind of training camp . Or doing nothing . Or doing nothing and , ah , teachers who only have three months off , do not get -- get -- get paid for those three months then . Right , they 're left to fend . They are the essence of our -- of our society , so I -- it 's just -- I think it 's very -- ah , it just makes them look like very poor -- they have poor character , they have poor , um , judgement . Exactly . And it 's just greed . It is . I agree one hundred per cent because I could see teachers complaining or anybody else that has to fend for themselves for this many months out of the year to make money to feed their families . These other people have money handed to them and they still complain . Exactly . I mean , look at even the airline industry where the pilots , mechanics and stewardess who are professionals at -- at -- and actually have a very , um , um , specific trade that they do . They took a cut in order to keep their -- their industry moving . Right . And keep their jobs . And these people -- But I see that as being a devotion where a lot of these sports players fall into something . They became a high school star which moved them to being a college star . Mhm . And all this ego . It 's a complete ego trip . They are told , " You're the best in high school " and may have been mediocre in college and then end up getting a pro job and then that 's it . And then there 's nothing else for them to do . Right . Yeah , or to become sports announcers . Because they have n't gone to college or anything . They skid through college just to be able to play these sports . That 's right , that 's right , and their -- and their skills as in writing , reading , mathm - mathematics is just poor . Oh , yeah . And -- and they have no where else to go at that point if something happens and then they have the gall to strike and ask for money when they have no other skills unlike these other professionals who have very specific skills , very needed skills , um , are taking pay cuts .
CT	I -- I really do n't know . And I wondered about that because I 'm sure that , you know , it -- it does help some , but a lot of people ... Well , it does -- it does help too because , you know , you do n't know if , you know , uh -- Yeah . -- terrorist going through the airports . But you have to open your trunk and everything . Yeah . Yeah . I mean , you do n't know if -- you know , because of all this , uh , high security checking on this . Mhm . And , uh -- because of terrorism and all this and , I mean , that 's why they 're doing it , and then to see if -- if there 's terrorists back into the airports and all that . So , I mean , in a way i- it 's good that 's they 're doing it , in a way it 's not , you know , because it does -- Yeah . They -- -- invade privacy too at the same time , you know ? They also have random checks . Oh , they do ? They did that both -- both times I was flying . Uh-huh . Um , and I do n't know if it 's , like , every fifth person or what . Oh , really ? But they 'll pull somebody out and they 'll look in their suitca - or their carry on bags -- Uh-huh . -- and they 'll check their shoes and everything , and it was kind of strange because there was no -- no way to tell -- Mhm . -- what kinda people they were pulling out . Yeah . I mean , like , most of them that I saw were , like , grandmothers . Oh , really ? And so people get offended , they get real offended by stuff like that , you know ? And that 's -- They think that they 're invading their privacy or , you know ... ? That 's the reason that I think it 's , you know , every certain number . Uh-huh . Because whenever I landed in , um -- oh , I ca n't remember where I -- Saint Louis I think is where I -- Mhm . -- had to change planes , uh , and they called the -- the flight was delayed for a lot of reasons . And then when they -- Oh , really ? -- finally did call for the flight -- Mhm . -- a lady and I stood up at the same time and she said , " Oh , go ahead " and so I got in line in front of her . Well , they pulled her out . Oh , no! So ... That 's embarrassing . I mean , I -- I -- she probably was embarrassed . I -- I know I would 've if it would 've been me . I think -- I think it 's just , you know , a random number that they -- Uh-huh . -- they pull out every -- Certain person . Yeah . Every so and so person . Yeah .
CT	You know . Yeah . Because , you know , who 's to say that they could put something in there and somehow or other , it did n't get scanned or do -- do -- do all pieces of luggage get scanned through or do they just do random checks on luggage too ? I do n't know , but I remember when I was flying at , um , you know , they had set up all these tables for pe- for them to go through everyone 's luggage , you know , like ran- like , random checks . Right . Through luggage . Right . And everything , but I do n't know , like , behind , you know , do they scan them 'em also ? I do n't know . No. I do n't know -- -- if we 'll ever really feel as safe as we ever did , I do n't know whether we ever will , you know . It 's like so many things can happen . Mhm . I really do n't care to fly any more I do n't believe . I did go there , went to [inaudible ] with -- with -- I travelled with my daughter but , of course , I guess if anything 's going to happen , it can happen on a plane or anywhere else either . Mhm , yeah , I think I 've flown -- flew twice . Really ? Yeah . Since then or just -- I actually flew in October . Oh , did you really ? Yeah , right afterwards . Oh , God , that would have scared me . That really would have scared me . I know I think shortly after that happened I believe my daughter did fly somewhere and it -- it -- it seemed like that 's all you 're thinking about . Mhm . You know . I think what scared me more , I do n't mind all the additional searches and everything . Uh-huh . But what scared me was just seeing all the , um , is that there , ah , g- -- the guards with their , you know , guns and everything walking around . Yeah , that would be -- that would be scary . That was what scared me . Yeah . I 'm just not a big fan of guns . So -- No. Being that close . I know it , I know it , I know . I hope they -- I do hope they come up with something that 's foolproof so that people will feel comfortable again . Mhm . But until then , I guess the majority of us will still be taking our chances every time we go up in the air . Yeah . But I think every time you go up in the air , you 're taking your chances anyway . Yeah . It 's just like getting in a car though , you 're taking a chance when you go off in a car for that matter . Yeah , I mean , it 's more a likelihood , right ? Mhm . I think air travel 's the safest . Right , that 's what they say . Yeah .
CT	Yeah . As a -- as a weapon that would -- that would bypass metal detectors , so ... Mhm . Yeah . I also think it 's interesting 'cause this is something fairly recent within the past few months . It 's our airline , so no longer -- like actually on the flight you ca n't have a line forming from the bathroom any more . Oh , is that true ? I did n't know that . Yeah . So , like if there 's somebody in the lavatory they have that little light on the -- Right . -- ceiling and -- Uh-huh . -- you ca n't stand up unless you need to just stretch or something . Oh , I did n't know that , so you ca n't go back -- You they 're getting -- you ca n't just walk around like you used to if you need to stretch or anything any more . Oh , I did n't know that . Yeah . Oh , I did n't -- Makes it bad for long flights . Right , yeah . Well , and some people -- you know if y- -- some people have medical conditions and need to get up and walk around and stuff , so -- Mhm . Oh , that 's inter- -- Yeah , maybe if you let the airline know in advance for medical they might allow it -- Uh-huh . -- but , not sure about if you do n't let them know . I did n't know that . Is -- was that just across the board or is that just in certain airlines ? Um , it 's an FAA thing . Oh -- So -- Oh . ' Cause I 've flown Southwest quite a few times and -- Uh-huh . -- every time they say , " Due to new like FAA regulations we are no longer allowed to people do this " . Oh , wow , see I have n't flown recently so -- sin- since they 've done that , so I 'd never heard that before . That 's interesting . I guess they do n't want people loitering in the isle way , huh ? Mhm . Yeah , o - okay , uh ... And then like inside the airport , um -- I go into the Salt Lake one for a connecting flight and they had one of those [inaudible ] diners there -- Mhm . -- and I was kinda surprised 'cause they gave you plastic silverware 'cause they 're not allowed to give out metal silverware any more . In -- on the plane , or in the actual , uh -- Um , in the airport . So -- Oh , in the airplane , so they do n't want you -- oh , oh that makes sense . So , like you went there and ordered like -- somebody in my group ordered like a mini steak -- Uh-huh . -- and then they got plastic silverware and they were kinda like , " How am I supposed to cut this ? " Like , " Well , we do n't have any sharp knives in the back either , so --
CT	No. And I am really , you know , thinking of how will we get out of there . Right . ' Cause to get in is much easier with all this power , but to get out and to make certain , ah , you know , peaceful process to -- to -- to have end of it , that 's what makes me really , you know , nervous because I do n't trust and I do n't believe in ability of local , you know , institutions so whatever they have left . Right . To , um , to -- to make reasonable progress in a short time at all . Yeah . And , ah , um , experience from Afghanistan which was that we are immigrants from Russia and experience in Afghanistan taught us , that , you know , people have different faces during day time and night time . Mhm . In those areas unfortunately , and you do n't know always that person that you speak during the day and he agree to [inaudible ] what he will do during the night time . Right . When nobody sees and , ah , I believe that , um , young people who are basically given the task -- many people who given the task and they 're probably very well trained but it 's hard to , um , to understand somebody else , um , way of thinking if it 's totally different from yours -- Exactly . -- you can look at the person and think that you know what they 're talking about but they have totally different -- Yeah , yeah , I agree . Yeah .

I mean , they have all these promises they 're going to be bringing food and water and all sort of stuff and then I 'm seeing on TV , you know , all these people are sitting there looking for food and water . Right . I mean , I -- I do n't want us going in there and doing something anywhere , whether it 's Iraq , whether it 's , um , you know , there are other Arab countries , no matter where it is , I do n't want them going in there , starting something and then leaving it and leaving these people . To another dictator . Yes . You know , I mean , and that -- and that -- that was my fear . And -- Yeah . -- you know , I -- I started wondering how much what we were hearing was -- I 'm not over there so I have no clue what is really going on other than what I see reported on TV and I know from personal experience that not everything that gets reported on TV is what 's actually going on .

So we may never see peace again on -- on this side of heaven anyway . That 's true . I know , um , the only thing is if -- -- we get in there and try to break , ah , Palestine and Israel up , that 's -- you know , I just hope we stand behind Israel because that 's what we 're supposed to do , I think . But they 've -- They 've got to show some people . Yeah , exactly . So . But ... Gosh , I totally agree with you . I 'm just -- it 's kind of scary to think -- You know , fortunately we have a Godly President -- Yeah . -- and so it 's going to work out well because he 's made the decision that he 's going to do what 's right .

I -- I 'm thinking abo- -- too , what , um , we were talking Korea and all that , the uprising over there and -- -- keep putting it in the news with this and , I 'm like -- -- well , I wish that we 'd concentrate on our efforts over there first , Afghanistan and Iraq , and get them under control , what we need to do and get them idiots out of there .

NW	As a federal corruption investigation edges closer to embattled Rep. Tom DeLay , two liberal groups plan to launch a TV advertisement this week in his suburban Houston district emphasizing the lawmaker 's ethics controversies . The TV spot will point out connections between the Sugar Land Republican and former lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who pleaded guilty to corruption charges last week in a Justice Department investigation of his dealings on Capitol Hill . DeLay , who denies wrongdoing , had several political ties with Abramoff . Also , former DeLay press secretary Michael Scanlon has pleaded guilty to conspiring with Abramoff to bilk Indian tribes of millions of dollars in fees . The DeLay ad , along with one to be aired in the Ohio district of GOP Rep. Bob Ney , who has been implicated in Abramoff 's schemes , is part of an effort to build support for cleaning up Congress , said Toby Chaudhuri , spokesman for the Campaign for America 's Future . His group , which receives significant funding from labor unions , and a watchdog group , the Public Campaign Action Fund , are sponsoring the ads and have run others attacking DeLay . They are expected to announce today an effort to pressure Congress to pass lobbying and campaign finance reforms this year . " Tom DeLay , Bob Ney and other powerful congressmen are caught in the middle of the worst corruption scandal to hit Washington since Watergate , " Chaudhuri said . Ney also denies breaking the law . A DeLay spokeswoman questioned the motives and connections of the organizations . The Campaign for America 's Future " consistently attack( s ) conservative leaders like President Bush and now they 're getting involved in a district they probably could n't point to on a map , " DeLay spokeswoman Shannon Flaherty said . " While I do n't know what the ad looks like , I can guess it will in no way depict the labor unions they 're affiliated with or what they really support -- higher taxes , more government control , and the laughable leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Nick Lampson . " Pelosi , of California , leads Democrats in the House . Former Congressman Lampson is unopposed for the Democratic nomination for DeLay 's 22nd Congressional District seat in the November election . Entangled in criminal investigations of his political activities in Texas and Washington , DeLay on Saturday relinquished his claim to the job of House majority leader , from which he stepped down temporarily in September after he was indicted in Travis County on money laundering and conspiracy charges relating to campaign finance . Voters in DeLay 's district surely are aware of his troubles , said Southern Methodist University political scientist Cal Jillson , but the television ads could serve to "energize ( DeLay 's ) opponents and discourage and dismay his supporters . " Austin political consultant Bill Miller , who often advises Republicans , said DeLay 's political situation has worsened and recommended that he consider running ads of his own soon . " He needs to spend money if he wants to begin to change things for the better for himself right now , unless and until events change , " Miller said . Flaherty said the campaign will keep its strategy private . DeLay faces a March primary against three GOP candidates . Former GOP Rep. Steve Stockman has filed for a place on the November ballot as an independent .
NW	As Snoopy once said after falling off his doghouse , " Life is full of rude awakenings . " There 'll be one nine days from now when Camp Snoopy leaves the Mall of America and takes the entire " Peanuts " gang with him . The Bloomington , Minn. , mall said Monday that several months of negotiations over the " Peanuts " brands ended without an agreement , which means the seven-acre amusement park will no longer be called Camp Snoopy . Mall officials said they had hoped to retain the name , given that creator Charles Schulz was born and grew up in the Twin Cities . " It was part of Minnesota folklore , " said Julie Hansen , a spokeswoman for the Mall of America . " We 're sad to see it go . " Hansen said the mall hoped to find a new theme "in the near future , " but visitors to the mall Monday said they had a hard time imagining the amusement park without Snoopy and the gang . A huge , inflatable Snoopy stands at the center of the park , and children can ride with Snoopy in his World War I biplane . Surrounding the rides are a half-dozen shops that sell " Peanuts " dolls and other merchandise . Schulz is memorialized with a bench featuring Snoopy and Woodstock sharing a cookie . Patrick Adams , 5 , looked visibly sad Monday as his mother , Angela , explained to him that Snoopy was decamping . " It looks like he 's waving goodbye , " said Patrick , pointing up at the front paw of the inflatable Snoopy . The mall lost the right to use Camp Snoopy and the " Peanuts " brands last March , after it took over management of the giant indoor amusement park from Cedar Fair , a Sandusky , Ohio-based company that operates seven theme parks nationwide . Cedar Fair has the exclusive right to use Snoopy and " Peanuts " characters at its theme parks in the United States under an arrangement with United Media , the New York licensing and syndication agency for " Peanuts . " Hansen , the mall spokeswoman , said the mall wanted to keep the " Peanuts " theme alive , but it also wanted to promote the park in key markets . " It was one of the sticking points " in negotiations over the use of the brand , Hansen said . " Cedar Fair would n't let us advertise the park the way we wanted to or needed to in order to promote the business . " In a statement issued Monday , the Mall of America said it was in negotiations with "exciting new brands " and expected to make an announcement about the park "very soon . " In the interim , the park will be referred to as " The Park at MOA " and will remain open . All Camp Snoopy tickets and coupons will remain valid . The change comes at a time when Charlie Brown and friends are undergoing something of a revival . The animated television special , " A Charlie Brown Christmas , " attracted 15 million viewers on Dec. 6 , the most in the special 's 40-year history . Advertisers paid as much as $ 200,000 for each 30-second spot during the special , which scored the highest ratings of any show on the night it aired . According to Forbes magazine , Schulz has become the second-most-profitable "dead celebrity , " with only the estate of Elvis Presley collecting more . In 2004 , the Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates earned about $ 35 million , largely from the sale of thematic clothing , toys and stationery . Camp Snoopy was particularly popular with tourists , who would often cite Camp Snoopy as their primary reason for visiting the mall . This summer , two Japanese tourists were married at the Mall of America as part of a trip to Camp Snoopy . Mall officials said crews will work after hours to remove the " Peanuts " memorabilia by Jan . 19 . Most of the rides will not be affected by the change because they are n't connected directly to a Snoopy theme . " There are more than 30 rides , lots of food and plenty of things to do , " Hansen said .
NW	Kimo von Oelhoffen , whose ancestry is a blend of Hawaiian and German , can come across as a 300-pound exotic . From the time he arrived on the mainland , no one knew quite what to make of him . Von Oelhoffen ( pronounced OHL-hoffen ) did not play football in high school and did not have a full career in college . When he joined the Pittsburgh Steelers ' defensive line , he would throw tires as part of his training regimen and keep a sewing machine in his locker so he could stitch teammates ' jerseys in his spare time . Von Oelhoffen has the strength of a bodybuilder and the touch of a tailor . Like many defensive linemen , he can seem both brutish and gentle . The rugged side of him came out Sunday , when Cincinnati quarterback Carson Palmer threw his first pass . As von Oelhoffen crashed into Palmer 's left leg and forced him to the ground , he could hear ligaments tear in Palmer 's knee . By the time television cameras focused on von Oelhoffen , he looked devastated . Palmer had not even reached the locker room and a debate was raging at Paul Brown Stadium about the legitimacy of the hit , as well as the hitter . Clean or dirty ? Character witnesses were busy gathering evidence on the field . Cincinnati players berated von Oelhoffen while Pittsburgh players tried to defend him . Palmer 's injury , a torn anterior cruciate ligament , serves as the latest reminder that every team in the playoffs is one hit away from elimination . The image of Palmer , carted off the field after his first and only playoff pass , will hang over this weekend 's games between the Redskins and the Seahawks , the Patriots and the Broncos , the Panthers and the Bears , and the Steelers and the Colts . All of those teams have stars they cannot afford to lose . Just as the Steelers and the Bengals faced each other twice in the regular season -- a footnote that raised the intensity of their final meeting -- every divisional playoff game this weekend is also a rematch . Defensive linemen know offensive linemen . Defensive backs know receivers . When high emotions meet high stakes , any collision could have damaging consequences . " In the playoffs , teams have to worry about injuries , " Pittsburgh receiver Hines Ward said . " It is still a part of football and people have to deal with it . " When von Oelhoffen was asked about his hit against Palmer , he initially sounded callous . " I 'm going to answer this question one time , " von Oelhoffen said after the game . " I was playing football . He was playing football . No more , no less . " But there was much more . " I just hope that kid gets better , " von Oelhoffen said . " He is a great football player . My apologies go out to him and his family . " As von Oelhoffen spoke , a sympathetic side of him emerged . " That 's the risk we all take playing this game , " he said . " It affected me . I 'd feel the same way if I was watching TV and I saw a quarterback tear his ACL . " The most destructive play of von Oelhoffen 's career is already the most famous . If von Oelhoffen had not hit Palmer , the Steelers might not be playing the Colts on Sunday . While Palmer is expected to have reconstructive surgery , van Oelhoffen is preparing to harass another Pro Bowl quarterback , Peyton Manning . Defensive linemen have a tricky job description : to inflict as much damage as possible without causing serious injury . Von Oelhoffen , attempting to straddle that narrow chalk line , said he tried to hit Palmer without hurting him . " I do n't know Kimo very well , " Cincinnati receiver T.J. Houshmandzadeh said . " But I talked to him through the course of the game and I do n't think he 's a dirty player . " If anything , von Oelhoffen 's determination might have been to blame . Just as every pass rusher is taught , he fought through a series of blocks and lunged at the quarterback . According to The Associated Press , Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis said Monday that von Oelhoffen should have been penalized for a late hit , but Palmer absolved the lineman of any wrongdoing . After watching a replay , Palmer said , " I do n't think it was malicious at all . " Considering where von Oelhoffen came from , it is remarkable that he is even on a playoff roster . He grew up in Kaunakakai , Hawaii , attending Molokai High School , which did not field a football team . He went to the University of Hawaii , then to Walla Walla ( Wash . ) Junior College , and finally to Boise State , where he was injured for part of two seasons . Although von Oelhoffen is a 12-year NFL veteran -- he spent half of his career with the Bengals , oddly enough -- only recently have fans learned to pronounce his name . He has 19 1/2 sacks in the past five seasons , startling because the Steelers play a 3-4 defense , which usually occupies linemen in the trenches and showcases the linebackers . Neither he nor his teammates would acknowledge the obvious -- that hurting an opposing quarterback helps to beat the opposing team , and that hurting Palmer improved the chances of a victory in Cincinnati . Without Palmer , the Bengals ' passing game could not fly . Now , the Steelers will have to beat the AFC 's best . The last time Pittsburgh met Indianapolis , Nov. 28 at the RCA Dome , Manning threw an 80-yard touchdown pass on the Colts ' first offensive play , leading to a 26-7 Colts ' victory . The Steelers will probably not divulge much of their defensive strategy , but it seems there is only one way for them to slow Manning : hit him as hard and as often as possible .
NW	Remember when you were out holiday shopping three weeks ago and on a whim decided to buy that new $ 400 coat ? Without enough money in your checking account , you whipped out your credit card and walked out of the store with a warm glow about you . Well , now it 's time to pay for that buying spree , plus whatever else you added to your cards during the holidays . If you 're among the millions who threw caution -- and their budgets -- to the wind and spent more money than they had intended , those warm and fuzzy holiday feelings soon will be turning into a cold chill as those credit card bills arrive in the mail . Donald Rehorn of ByDesign Financial Solutions in Sacramento warns that not only are consumers facing larger bills following the holidays , but some will have to pay more than they have in the past . Rehorn says new regulations taking effect this year require larger minimum credit card payments at the same time that higher fuel costs are taking more money out of pocketbooks . " The new regulations requiring an increase in the minimum credit card payments may hit those who can least afford it , " he says . Judging from a recent decline in consumer borrowing , perhaps some consumers are anticipating the change . Consumer credit dropped by an annual rate of 4.7 percent in October and then dipped another 0.4 percent in November , according to the Federal Reserve . Borrowers should expect to experience a more aggressive collection environment , Rehorn warns . " The new bankruptcy regulations that went into effect last year are perceived to make it more difficult to file . More aggressive creditors are using that perception to pressure consumers to pay up , and that in turn puts more pressure on those who can least afford a major change in spending , " says Rehorn , whose company was formerly known as Consumer Credit Counseling Service of the Sacramento Valley . With the start of the new year , Jennifer Openshaw , chief executive of Openshaw 's Family Financial Network in Los Angeles , says it 's a good time to focus on your debts . " Your goal , " she says " should be to wipe out all of your holiday credit card debts by March . " Remember , if you charge $ 1,000 and only make the minimum payments , you 'll pay on that for months and months and rack up an additional $ 400 in interest charges . " But if you pay it off by March , it will only cost you $ 50 in interest charges , Openshaw adds . Sacramento certified financial planner Laura Pajak advises consumers to start the year by putting a price tag on their lifestyle . " Once you 've created that budget , you can see where you will have to make changes to find the money to pay off your credit card debts , " she says . Then you have to set a realistic timetable to pay off the debt , she adds . " You might find that you have to put a temporary moratorium on going to Starbucks . Instead of three trips a week , you might have to cut back to once a month . " Make a sprint out of paying off your debt , she advises . " Go lean and mean for four months and pay it all off . " Rehorn , whose nonprofit company has been counseling Sacramento Valley residents for more than 40 years , says there are several ways to reduce your debts and improve your overall financial health . The first step , he says , is to " create your own get-out-of-debt plan . That starts with a family meeting to bring spending under control and to create a plan that involves every member of the family . " If you 're going to get out of debt , he says , you need to write down your financial goals and be specific . " Just make sure everyone in your household is on the same page , " Rehorn says . Once you determine how much you spend on basic living costs , then you 'll begin to see how much you have to allocate to your debt . Obviously , he says , the more money you can allocate to your debt , the better off you will be . At the same time , he notes , "you have to stop digging your pile of debt any deeper . If you are already in debt , stop charging altogether , " he says . " Pay only with cash , check or debit card . " Many consumers , Rehorn says , have run up debts on multiple credit cards . He recommends that consumers pay off the smallest credit card balance first . " Sure , it 's wise to pay off the highest-balance card first , but I believe that success builds success and there is great accomplishment in paying of a credit card . " Since most people did n't end up with a pile of debts instantaneously , they wo n't be able to wipe out that debt all at once . You 've got to take it a step at a time , and what better time to start than right now ? Jack Sirard is a personal finance columnist for The Sacramento Bee .

NW	Ever the avant-garde guy , Dallas owner Mark Cuban took up commissioner David Stern on his suggestion to have a so-called " Silent Night " and stop what has unfortunately become an NBA staple : the blaring , nonstop music and mindless noise during games . Cuban ordered the plugs pulled during the Mavericks ' Dec. 30 game against Golden State at American Airlines Center . " I liked it , " he said via e-mail , " but I hated that there was less energy in the arena . " Cuban said he received e-mails about the move and that fans supported a return to the ear-splitting assault by a 10-1 ratio . That has long been Cuban 's contention - that most people do not attend NBA games to see the product , God forbid , but to "have a good time . " In an apparently unrelated development , the Warriors rallied in the fourth quarter and won , 111-109 . The change in Spain When the Spanish team assembles in Japan next summer for the World Championships , it will have a new coach . Mario Pesquera , who made headlines in Athens by engaging in a finger-pointing duel with US coach Larry Brown - to the point where Brown was said to have asked , " Do you want a piece of me ? " - was sacked before Christmas and replaced by longtime Spanish club coach Pepu Hernandez . Pesquera accused Brown of piling on when Brown , his team leading by 12 with 23 seconds to play , called a timeout . Brown later said - rather lamely - that he tried to wave it off , but Pesquera was n't buying the Mickey the Dunce routine . He told reporters that Dean Smith , Brown 's idol , would never have stooped to such depths . Brown tried to say that he was new to the international situation , that he had just seen two US turnovers and that , well , he was n't out to embarrass anyone . None of it was believable , because in the NBA , coaches always take needless timeouts ( although they would disagree ) . Pesquera 's last performance as national coach was to lead Spain to a fourth-place finish in the World Championship qualifier last year in Belgrade . That was good enough to get the Spanish team to Japan , but not good enough to keep his job . Shakeup in Seattle Bob Hill has been a face on several NBA benches over the years - you may recall he coached the Pacers when they met the Celtics in the 1991 and 1992 playoffs - and now he has surfaced in Seattle , replacing the deposed Bob Weiss . Hill wasted no time making changes on what is a very ordinary team , a unit that makes the Celtics look like the Spurs defensively . Vladimir Radmanovic , who was upset with his playing time under Weiss , got his first start of the season in the team 's victory Wednesday over reeling Chicago . Luke Ridnour , who started the first 26 games , was returned to the starting lineup in Game 31 ( he had missed two games with a chest bruise ) . Rookie center Johan Petro got his 10th start and went 31 minutes , which is more minutes than he compiled in the previous five games dating back to Nov. 30 . ( He played only 19 minutes over four games in December . ) Lastly , Robert Swift was exhumed and went 8 minutes , which amounted to 50 percent of the time he had previously spent on the floor covering three games in December . Hill also has implemented a gag order at practice , unless players are helping out each other , and wants his assistant coaches to button it during games as well . Stairway to headache Interesting line from former Celtics coach John Carroll , who was writing on ESPN.com about the pressures of being an interim coach on a team trying to develop players . " I kept hearing , 'Play this guy , play that guy ' from upstairs , " Carroll wrote . " What a headache . " He did not identify who was "upstairs . " He also was asked by someone "upstairs " to call more dunks for Ricky Davis . Ready for takeoff RIP America West Arena . With the merger between airlines , the arena the Phoenix Suns call home is now known as US Airways Center . This is n't the first arena deal for US Air .

By that time , the team name also had been changed to the Wizards . Material from personal interviews , wire services , other beat writers , and league and team sources was used in this report .
NW	FOXBOROUGH - The Jaguars felt disrespected and now they know why . Jacksonville fought its underdog tag all week . The Jaguars fought the Patriots hard and only trailed , 7-3 , at halftime . Then the visitors fought themselves , collapsing in the second half of a 28-3 New England rout last night . A game so manageable at one point turned into a complete disaster for the Jaguars . " We were right there in the first half , but then in the second half , they put together a nice drive , made some third downs , and got a score , " said Jacksonville coach Jack Del Rio . " We had a ball dropped [ by Jimmy Smith ] on third down , which would have extended a drive for us . Instead of keeping it close , they scored , and that 's where it got away from us . " The Jaguars , who went 12-4 in the regular season , were correct when they said weather would n't be a factor last night . It was n't . The experts were right when they said Byron Leftwich would be rusty after not playing for six weeks . Leftwich failed to throw a touchdown pass to his own receivers , though he did throw one to Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel for a 73-yard touchdown return early in the fourth quarter . It was evident Leftwich might have been better served sitting this one out ( as he had the previous five games because of a broken ankle ) and letting the more mobile David Garrard start . Blaming the loss on Leftwich , however , was n't something Del Rio was prepared to do . " Aside from the interception , I thought he played well , " Del Rio said of Leftwich , who completed 18 of 31 passes for 179 yards . " I thought he was accurate with the ball . We did n't function well enough . I thought if we tackled and blocked we would have been in a better position . I know that you need to play fundamentally sound in big games and we did n't . We had a minus-2 turnover ratio and you need a healthy , positive ratio to win these games . " There were other disappointments that led to the loss . The Jaguars , who rushed 502 times this season for a 3.9-yard average , could not mount a running attack against the New England 's front seven , even without Tedy Bruschi , who watched the game on the sideline while Monty Beisel filled his spot . Jacksonville 's leading rusher was Leftwich , who had 26 yards on three carries . Fred Taylor managed just 24 yards on eight rushes . Del Rio acknowledged his game plan was to throw the ball a lot to try to exploit the New England 's secondary . He felt the Patriots had a strong front seven , but that Leftwich could get the ball to a receiving corps that had a decided height advantage . But dropped passes offset any advantage the Jaguars had . Del Rio hoped to get enough pressure on Tom Brady with his much-heralded defensive line without blitzing . But that strategy did n't pan out , and , eventually , the Jaguars had to start using linebackers and corners to blitz , leaving holes in the middle of the field . Middle linebacker Mike Peterson , who played with a cast on his right wrist , could n't wrap up Benjamin Watson on a third and 13 late in the third quarter , which would have stopped the Patriots . But Watson broke Peterson 's tackle and rambled 63 yards for a touchdown . " I ai n't going to make any excuses , " Peterson said . " I should have made the play . " Del Rio thought Peterson might have been affected by the cast and said , " That 's where we could have used two healthy hands . " The Jaguars were also extremely unlucky . Peterson had forced a Watson fumble after an 8-yard reception at the Jaguars 12 , but the loose ball was recovered by Patriots receiver Andre ' Davis , and from there New England extended its lead to 14-3 when Brady found David Given in the end zone from 3 yards out . " We made a good play there and we could n't come up with the ball , " Peterson said . " That 's the way it went for us all day . We could n't make a big play when we needed it .

" I started limping , " said Leftwich . " The ankle did n't hold up in the end , the field was so bad so Jack seen me limping and thought it was best to get me out of there so I would n't cause further injury to it . " Leftwich said the Patriots played a form of Cover-2 defense , " that they had n't shown in the previous 10 games they 'd played . " Leftwich said his receivers were often double-covered down the field and he felt New England guessed right on most of Jacksonville 's pass plays . Leftwich said the Patriots did n't blitz him as often as he thought they would . " Just to be in the huddle was very exciting , " said Leftwich . " We had some things going on in the first half and we always find a way to answer , but we could n't this time . " Del Rio said he congratulated the team for a good season . " We feel we have better football ahead of us , " he said . " I 'm proud of the year but disappointed for them on the finish . It 's not a good way to finish . "
NW	Eight years ago , one day after Ryan Leaf nearly led Washington State to an upset of Michigan in the Rose Bowl , Colts general manager Bill Polian sat in his seat at the Orange Bowl and watched gimpy Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning throw for a measly 134 yards in a 42-17 pounding by Nebraska . To Polian , Manning 's poor performance that night in front of a national television audience -- he passed for nearly 200 yards below his average that season -- did n't much matter . Four months later , the Colts chose Manning with the first pick and left Leaf to the Chargers with the second . We all know how that turned out . " We evaluate thoroughly , " Polian said of the influence the bowl games had on his decision . " We evaluate the guys ' whole career from start to finish . I did n't think there was anything untoward about Peyton in that game . They lost to a better team and he was playing on a bad knee . " That is the question being raised around the NFL in the wake of Texas quarterback Vince Young 's scintillating performance in the Rose Bowl : How much influence do you place on one game ? Prior to the Rose Bowl , it appeared a foregone conclusion that Reggie Bush would be the first player picked . Matt Leinart , due to the value of his position , would be next and Young , if he chose not to return to school , perhaps somewhere in the top 10 . Now , after overshadowing the two USC stars -- and everyone else on the field -- how much has Young 's performance changed things ? " There 's an old saying in scouting : Do n't upgrade a guy based on an all-star game and do n't downgrade a guy based on an all-star game , " Polian said . " In a general sense , the same is true of a bowl game . But I was at the Fiesta Bowl and it was the same as the Rose Bowl . Those were intense , hard-fought football games . That 's something you put stock in , but again , it 's only part of the puzzle . " What was significant about Young 's performance is that , as an unconventional quarterback , he has to prove his skill set will translate to the pros . While he wo n't be running through NFL defenses with quite the ease that he did against the Trojans and his throwing motion remains disquieting , Young 's leadership skills and accuracy in a high-stakes setting were impressive , one scout said . " If you asked me two years ago , I would have said he 's a heck of an athlete , but I do n't think he can play quarterback , " said the scout , from an AFC team . " But the guy 's gotten better . I ca n't count him out . " I do n't think you 're ever going to fix his throwing motion and he 's going to have some shortcomings , but with everything else he can do you live with it . He 's cool , he 's a big-game competitor , he 's got all the intangibles . People compare him to Mike Vick because of the athletic ability , but his teammates love him and he 's got the respect of his coaches . I do n't think you can say that about a guy like Vick . What he did is what Tom Brady does . " If Young may have changed some minds , Bush and Leinart were more likely to reinforce opinions . Polian , who watched USC play in person twice this season , scoffed at those who questioned Leinart 's arm strength , instead crediting safety Michael Griffin with a tremendous break on the ball he intercepted . As for Bush , he said : " All I know is every time he touches the ball , you hold your breath . " Of Bush , the scout said : " He was n't the best player on the field for the first time in his career , but he still had a real good game . " Of Leinart , the scout said : " He played well in the second half , but everybody knows what he is -- they 've been watching him closely for two years . He 's a good game manager , but he 's not going to win a game by himself . He needs a bunch of guys around him . " There 's still four months to go before the draft , but the Texans have told Bush 's camp they are still enamored with him . If the Saints hire Mike Martz , who has seen what few others have in Trent Green , Kurt Warner and Mark Bulger , they would figure to target Leinart , whose decision making would be valued -- as well as his marketing appeal if they expect to be in Los Angeles after next season . That could put Young in Tennessee , where he would wait behind his mentor Steve McNair , whom he has known since high school . Nevertheless , despite all the excitement in Houston last week over the Texans securing the rights to -- presumably -- Bush , Young 's performance has changed that dynamic , too . Now the hue and cry is for the Texans to dump David Carr and keep Young , a Houston native , at home . At this time in 1998 , Polian got an earful , too . Manning could n't win the big one , Leaf had more upside . " That was said in the media , " Polian said . " I do n't think anybody ever said it in the meetings . I 've never put much stock in what 's been said publicly . We do n't concern ourselves with the stories when we 're trying to make accurate judgments . " That may be sage advice , but it might be hard to remember when watching film of the Rose Bowl and wondering what might be .
NW	Sixteen-year-olds ca n't vote , enter into a legally binding contract or join the military . But if they commit a crime , they can be tried as an adult . If the crime is serious enough , they can be put away for the rest of their lives . North Carolina and two other states automatically treat 16-year-olds as adults in criminal courts ; most states set the adult age at 17 or 18 . The N.C . Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission , which advises lawmakers on sentencing laws , has begun studying whether North Carolina should raise the minimum age of adulthood for criminal cases . " The underlying theme is are we doing what is most appropriate for that age group -- 16 to 21 -- in terms of programs , in terms of the law , " said Susan Katzenelson , executive director of the sentencing commission . Among other things , she said , the commission will examine the rate of further involvement in crime for teenagers with adult convictions , versus those who receive juvenile status . The commission took up the study at the request of state Rep. Alice Bordsen , a Democrat . Bordsen said the law , which has been on the books since at least 1919 , makes no sense in today 's world . " You are not legally responsible for anyone , much less yourself , until you are 18 , but if you flip over to the criminal side of the law we say you are fully accountable for your crimes , " Bordsen said . conviction causes for teenagers .

He said there are less dramatic measures that lawmakers should consider , such as allowing young adults convicted of low-level felonies to have their record cleared . criminal courts automatically treat 16-year-olds as adults . But in contrast with North Carolina , those states allow for exceptions : 16 - and 17-year-old defendants can petition to be treated as youthful offenders , Bordsen said . under 18 are tried as adults . But state prison records show that 396 teenagers 17 and younger were sent to prison in 2004 to serve sentences as adults . Of that group , 55 were 16 years old , six were 15 and one inmate was 14 . Only 31 of the 396 teenagers were female . said the males are housed in a special prison in Morganton , N.C. , where staff members try to get them back on track academically .

" ( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. ) Jennings ' widow , Kayce Freed Jennings , herself a former ABC producer , said Banner had been a critical conduit for her husband during his illness , including him in conference calls and traveling to his apartment regularly to talk strategy . " Jon would n't accept anything but that Peter was an integral part of the broadcast every day and would be there forever , " Ms. Jennings said . ( END OPTIONAL TRIM. ) David Westin , the president of ABC News , said Banner somehow struck a balance at work . ( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. ) " Peter used to say about Jon , when he was a senior producer , that he was a 'news nun , " ' Westin said . " Peter meant it as a high compliment -- that he is married to the news . " The notion that Banner is married to ABC is not far off . He married an ABC producer , Sara Diamond , whom he dated while both were covering the bombing trial of Timothy McVeigh . " I was there with Dean Reynolds , " Banner said of the veteran reporter , and Diamond was there with a " Good Morning America " correspondent . " We got engaged in California one weekend when the jury was not deliberating . " The couple now has two daughters , ages 5 and 2. And yet , lest anyone think ABC is more family than business , Westin 's bottom-line goal for Banner has not changed : that he return the broadcast to being the most-watched . " I do n't like to put timetables on it , but we are not in this to be No. 2 , " Westin said . ( END OPTIONAL TRIM. ) In the months immediately after Jennings became sick , " World News Tonight , " led by alternating anchors ( mostly Vargas and Charles Gibson of " Good Morning America " ) continued to lag behind NBC in average viewership but actually overtook NBC in a critical demographic category : viewers aged 25 and 54 , the metric against which advertising rates are set . From early April until late August , NBC drew an average of 2.67 million viewers a night in that demographic , about 57,000 fewer than the 2.73 million ABC drew , according to Nielsen Media Research . But since Labor Day , ABC , led mostly by Woodruff and Vargas on alternating nights , has fallen farther behind Williams ' broadcast among total viewers ( a gap of more than a million ) and in the demographic , where NBC has opened a lead of about 170,000 viewers , according to Nielsen . For now , however much Vargas , 43 , and Woodruff , 44 , may have traveled the world as correspondents in recent years , it is Williams , 46 , with a year as full-time anchor , who can best lay claim to the tagline " Trust is earned . " Complicating ABC 's efforts is that all of the evening newscasts are losing viewers , many to the Internet -- hence the network 's fledgling Webcast , which viewers can download beginning in the midafternoon in the East .

NW	When Howard Stern begins his first broadcast on Sirius Satellite Radio Monday morning , he may be playing to a diminished audience , but his impact on the future of satellite radio has already been substantial . The next question is whether Stern 's extraordinary compensation will have any effect on the way on-air talent is paid . Last week , Sirius announced that it had granted Stern and his manager more than 34 million shares of common stock , currently worth about $ 225 million , because certain subscriber levels had been reached . That is on top of the $ 500 million that Sirius had already agreed to pay Stern for his salary and production costs . Stern now holds more shares than any other single investor , according to David J. Frear , Sirius ' executive vice president and chief financial officer . Whether or not Stern 's show , which begins at 6 a.m. , is a success , his decision to jump from free broadcast to subscription radio has bestowed legitimacy on a medium that many had regarded with skepticism . Sirius ' number of subscribers has jumped from 660,000 at the time Stern 's deal was announced in October 2004 , to 3.3 million today . " Clearly a lot of that is attributable to Howard Stern , " said Jim Collins , a vice president at Sirius . As a result of its growth , the company 's initial $ 500 million investment in Stern will be covered by the subscriber increase , Collins said . Still , XM Satellite Radio remains the leader in the industry . While Sirius added more listeners in the final quarter of 2005 , XM ended the year with more than 6 million subscribers . The decision by Stern to move to satellite radio may also encourage other talent to migrate to the fledgling medium . " Actors never wanted to be on cable until some of them started to win awards , " said Agnes Lukasewych , a vice president at MPG , a media planning company . XM previously announced that both Bob Dylan and the hosts of ABC 's " Good Morning America " would create shows for the company . Sirius has plans for programming from Martha Stewart and Bill Bradley . With broadcast radio losing the large audiences attracted by Stern , Lukasewych says she expects that advertisers will need to buy more spots to reach the same number of listeners . " Terrestrial radio has to step up to the plate " and work to attract new talent , she said . The problem will deepen over the next several years , as MP3 players and new Internet-based music ventures , such as Motorola 's iRadio service , strive to grab consumers ' attention . "XM and Sirius got to their current subscriber levels fairly easily , but at what point do they reach some level of saturation due to increased competition ? " said Danielle Levitas , a senior analyst with IDC . " There is value in having some sort of cachet with unique programming . " While Stern 's agreement with Sirius helped put the company on the map , performers giving a second thought to satellite radio should not anticipate the lucrative arrangement that Stern was able to negotiate . " There is n't anybody else in Howard 's class . If Sirius had not done something they would have been totally in the dust , " said Paul Kagan , chairman of PK Worldmedia , a Carmel , Calif. , research firm . " You do n't often see a network mortgaging itself to bring in a star . " XM said it did not have plans to mix up its programming because of Stern 's new program . " Our content has not changed , " said Eric Logan , XM 's executive vice president of programming . " We have a platform targeted at mainstream America . There are more and more people who find Howard Stern repulsive and offensive and will go away from anywhere he is . " Nor does XM expect Stern 's salary to have much of an impact on the broader industry . Logan noted that a number of performers had asked to do shows without compensation , simply to be on XM. Stern 's salary "is so far out of whack that it does not do anything to the economics of the business , " Logan said . Sirius has given Stern two channels to program . His four-hour show airs at 6 a.m. on both coasts , live in the East and tape-delayed in the West . In addition to the live show , programming will include Howard 100 News , a news operation "reporting on the world of Howard . " " Howard will be doing a show that he has n't done for 15 years , because he 's been held back " by the Federal Communications Commission , said Patrick Reilly , senior vice president of communications for Sirius . " It 's not about swearing , it 's about being candid , doing creative performance work for radio . "
NW	Two months ago Time magazine jumped at the chance to make a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster for the exclusive serial rights to " At Canaan 's Edge : America in the King Years , 1965-68 , " the third volume in Taylor Branch 's Pulitzer Prize-winning series on the civil rights movement that comes out Tuesday . " I moved quickly on it because I think it 's a terrific book , it 's long awaited , it 's very dramatic , " said Stephen J. Koepp , the deputy managing editor at Time . Time , which is owned by Time Warner , put together a big package for its Jan . 9 issue , including a cover photograph of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , an eight-page excerpt from the book , exclusive photos , and an online interview with Branch . The issue went online on Sunday , Jan . 1 , and landed on newsstands a day later . But the editors at Time got a rude surprise when they looked online that same Sunday morning and saw that Newsweek 's issue included a long essay about King and Branch 's book written by Jonathan Alter , one of Newsweek 's senior editors and columnists . While the book was not embargoed prior to release , it had been sent out to many media outlets for review , and Newsweek had put in a bid . To Koepp , Newsweek 's piece smacked of dirty pool . " I knew that other people had access to it . There 's a kind of an honor system that if you 've read a book for serial rights and you 're not going to buy them , you do n't go and do the book before it 's out , and we observe that , " he said . " Obviously , not everybody else does . " Jon Meacham , the managing editor of Newsweek , which is owned by the Washington Post Co. , said that there was nothing sneaky about publishing Alter 's essay . The publication of the book is a "big , literary historical event " and Alter had a unique perspective to offer , said Meacham . But Meacham did say that Alter 's essay was in part a response to Time 's package . " Sure we 're in constant competition , and that 's what 's fun about it , " he said . The biggest beneficiaries of the skirmish , of course , are Simon &amp; Schuster and Branch . " I believe the phrase in the industry is 'a spoiler , ' which one might cynically think this is , " said David Rosenthal , publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster . He added , " It 's great attention on the book . " Koepp , while less than pleased , said he was consoled by the fact that Time 's coverage was more substantial than Newsweek 's . " To the extent that we 're the first big taste of this for readers , for someone else to be nibbling at the edges of this , it 's not ideal , " he said . " But I greeted it with a shrug . " -- LIA MILLER PUBLIC RADIO LISTENERS WANT THEIR MONEY BACK When the public radio station in Detroit canceled some local music shows and replaced them with nationally syndicated talk and news programs , it probably expected some complaints from listeners . What it got was a lawsuit from seven listeners asking for their pledge money back . A group of listeners to WDET-FM in Detroit filed a class-action lawsuit against the station on Dec. 19 , claiming fraud and breach of contract . The Detroit Free Press reported that seven plaintiffs filed for damages after contributing to the station 's last on-air fundraising pledge drive , which ended in October . Station managers announced the new schedule on Dec. 13 . The listeners claim that they were tricked into contributing money for programs that the station already planned to cancel . " They took our money six weeks before they made the changes , " said Dan Sordyl , a member of the committee for SaveDetroitRadio.com , a Web site started by disgruntled listeners after WDET 's announcement . Sordyl says that he is trying to negotiate a compromise with WDET or Wayne State University , which owns the station . Like other public radio stations , WDET depends on private funds for the bulk of its operating budget ; in WDET 's case , about 90 percent comes from the private sector . Listeners are regularly entreated to donate through on-air pledge drives , and this active solicitation has the side effect of increasing audience interest in , and response to , programming decisions . A similar lawsuit in New Mexico in 1987 resulted in a station there calling public hearings before making further programming changes . " There was no relationship between the timing of the announcement and our fall fund drive , " said Michael Coleman , the general manager of WDET. He would not comment on the lawsuit , but he noted that the changes reversed previous programming decisions that had replaced some national staples like " Fresh Air " and " Car Talk " with locally produced music shows . The new schedule restores and increases the amount of programming that comes from National Public Radio . " It 's a better business decision and it 's a better service to this urban market , " Coleman said of the schedule changes . " I think public radio needs to be about more than music programming .

NW	Israel continued its nervous watch over the sickbed of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Sunday , with television reporters educating the country about his condition using plastic models of brains and exploring hypotheses about whether Sharon should have had different treatment before his devastating stroke on Wednesday . Israeli politicians , normally an obstreperous and aggressive bunch , maintained a self-imposed moratorium on political campaigning out of respect for the stricken prime minister -- and out of a sense that the country would not reward those who returned to the normal slash-and-burn style too soon . Doctors treating Sharon intend to begin bringing him out of a medically induced coma on Monday after finding further improvement during a brain scan taken on Sunday , a hospital official said . Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef , the director of Hadassah-Ein Kerem Hospital , said Sunday that Sharon , 77 , remained in critical condition after his massive stroke last Wednesday but that his vital signs , including the pressure inside his cranium , were normal and that he did not have a fever . " His condition is still serious but stable , and there is improvement in the CT picture of the brain , " Mor-Yosef said . Still , doctors decided to wait until Monday to bring Sharon out of the coma after suggesting on Saturday that they might begin the process on Sunday . It could take up to eight hours . Israelis found themselves in an unfamiliar state of limbo -- obsessed with Sharon 's condition but not used to waiting . " People are not patient , " said Maya Bader , 27 , a doctoral student having coffee with her mother at a Tel Aviv cafe . " They want to know what is happening . People do n't know what to do . " Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert presided over the regular Sunday Cabinet meeting , and in televised remarks at the start , pledged continuity with Sharon 's policies . Olmert said , " I pray with all the people of Israel that my tenure as the acting prime minister will be short . " But it is likely to last at least until the March 28 elections . Shimon Peres , the former Labor Party prime minister who joined Sharon and Olmert in the new Kadima Party , said Sunday that he expected Olmert to lead the party into the elections . Peres , 82 , said on CNN that he was interested in returning as a member of the legislature on the Kadima list , but that he did not intend to compete with Olmert to become prime minister . " I want to devote whatever time and energy I have for the peace process , " he said .
NW	Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has chosen the top planner in San Diego to lead the Los Angeles Planning Department , capping a lengthy search for an official who will influence how the city grows in the 21st century . The mayor plans to officially introduce S. Gail Goldberg at a press conference today . A planner in San Diego since 1988 and the director of planning there since 2001 , Goldberg is closely associated with a neighborhood-focused growth strategy that has been dubbed the " City of Villages " approach . " While Los Angeles is much larger than San Diego , the fact is that in both cities we have some wonderful , distinct neighborhoods that have unique characteristics and people identify more with the neighborhoods than the entire city , " Goldberg told the Daily News on Saturday . " I think in order to increase density or do smart growth you need to work closely with the neighborhood groups and concentrate on the areas where the folks are ready to do some revitalization . " Councilman Ed Reyes , head of the City Council 's Planning and Land Use Committee and himself a former city planner , praised the appointment . " She brings a certain amount of energy and optimism and a down-to-earth approach that I think creates a sense of confidence , " said Reyes . Los Angeles officials have been searching for a new head of the Planning Department since Con Howe announced his retirement in late 2004 . In September , Villaraigosa appointed an interim director , Mark Winogrond , who spearheaded a national search . Ultimately the mayor interviewed three candidates before settling on Goldberg . " She understands complex regional issues but she 's also always simultaneously thinking of it from the community/neighborhood perspective , " Winogrond said . In San Diego , Goldberg was sensitive to community concerns about preserving open space and the character of neighborhoods , said David Abel , publisher of The Planning Report . Goldberg said she accomplished this by working closely with dozens of community planning groups and by tailoring denser , in-fill development to the character of the surrounding areas . " Given the mayor 's vision for the role and value of planning the city of L.A. going forward , there probably is n't a better professional that he could have chosen in the country , " Abel said . Howe , who worked with Goldberg during his tenure as Planning Director and through the Urban Land Institute , called her " a first-rate professional " and a strong choice . " I think they have a very good neighborhood planning program and I 'm sure she 'll bring some of that to the city , " he said . Goldberg will be moving from a department of 100 employees with a $ 10 million to $ 15 million budget to one of nearly 300 workers and a $ 20 million budget . She will also confront critics who have accused the Los Angeles agency of proceeding project-by-project without a broader vision . Some have pointed to a lack of resources to explain any neglect of long-range planning . Department officials moved last week to try to ease problems , announcing an expansion that includes 20 new planners . Goldberg said she is aware of some of the Los Angeles agency 's challenges , and she said she is heartened by the recent expansion . In particular she would like to use the additional staff to coordinate development and transportation planning . " We have to do a good job of permit processing , but that has to be balanced with long-range plans , " she said . While not familiar with Goldberg , Gordon Murley said he is optimistic based on his knowledge of San Diego . A longtime Planning Department critic as a Woodland Hills activist , Murley was recently appointed to the South Valley Area Planning Commission by Villaraigosa . Murley pointed to San Diego 's healthy downtown and university areas and to the way traffic flows through its subdivisions and freeways . " I guess she 's been working well in San Diego because a lot of their planning has been far superior to what we 've done here , " he said . Goldberg , 62 and a San Bernardino native , said she was persuaded to leave San Diego by the excitement of working with Villaraigosa . She said she shares his commitment to smart growth and promoting affordable housing . " There 's a lot of hope and possibilities in Los Angeles , " she said .
NW	Richard J. Bressler , the former chief financial officer of Viacom , said Sunday that he planned to join Thomas H. Lee Partners , the Boston-based private equity firm . The firm is expected to formally announce the appointment on Monday . Bressler , a veteran of the media industry who has held several top positions at Viacom and Time Warner , is the latest highly ranked executive from corporate America to join the ranks of the burgeoning and lucrative private equity industry . Bressler said last January that he would leave Viacom . For Thomas H. Lee Partners , the move comes at a time of change . Its founder , Thomas H. Lee , is expected to step down from the firm as part of a long-standing succession plan this year . The firm is also near to closing its latest fund , which could be worth as much as $ 10 billion . Bressler , 48 , will become a managing director and head the firm 's strategic resources group , which helps advise the managements of companies the firm owns . Thomas H. Lee Partners owns several media companies , including Warner Music and American Media , the publisher of Star magazine and The National Inquirer . Bressler has been a director and the chairman of the audit committee of Warner Music . " For me , the question was what to do with all of this experience and what would be the best role for me ? " Bressler said in an interview . " The fit for me at this firm was just right . I feel very fortunate . " After Lee departs , Thomas H. Lee Partners will be run by three co-presidents : Anthony J. DiNovi , Scott A. Schoen and Scott M. Sperling . Sperling said the firm planned to build up its strategic resources group even further by hiring other industry veterans . Historically , the firm 's partners have also had responsibility for overseeing investments . This move appears to be a slight strategic shift to add more operating expertise . The firm 's current $ 6.1 billion fund , which started investing in 2001 , has been a big success , with deals including Warner Music Group , TransWestern Publishing and National Waterworks . The company hit one pothole with its investment in Refco , the futures and commodities brokerage firm that collapsed last year .
NW	Barney and Harriet left their 3,000-square-foot loft in Brooklyn and scampered back to the country . With their lease expired and their acting careers temporarily curbed , they went home to do what everyone in show business does between gigs : sit by the phone and wait for someone to throw them a bone . Barney , who is not exactly begging for work , can use the rest . He spent a year and a half taking bows alongside Marlo Thomas in " Paper Doll , " a theatrical production staged in Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Connecticut . When that curtain closed , he left Marlo for Harriet , coming to New York for a role in " Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , " which ended a nine-month run on Dec. 31 at the Hilton Theater in Times Square . Barney , a miniature poodle , and Harriet , a pit bull , are two of the hardest-working animals on and off Broadway , having to endure months of rigorous training to meet the demands of live theater . With all due respect to Lassie , Flipper and Mr. Ed , theater animals face much greater challenges than their television and movie counterparts . They do not have the luxury of working with a trainer who may be standing just off-camera , or of reshooting a scene should one of them -- at least in Mr. Ed 's case -- blow a line . " Barney , Harriet and other animals who perform live must get it right the first time , " said William Berloni , 49 , a longtime trainer of theater animals . " It 's harder for an animal to perform for an actor on stage as opposed to a trainer on film . " The poodle , the pit bull , and a kit and caboodle of creatures eagerly awaiting their next casting call live on Berloni 's farm in Haddam , Conn. , which is also his headquarters for Theatrical Animals , a business that provides talent to film and theater companies . Berloni said that throughout the years , most of his clients were rescued from animal shelters , as was Sandy , the dog he discovered and trained in the mid-1970s who went from death row to celebrity row during the Broadway run of " Annie . " Need a horse to neigh on cue ? A canary to sing like a mobster ? A llama to do , well , whatever you need a llama to do ? Just call Berloni , agent to the stars of the animal kingdom . Need a trained rat ? Do n't call Berloni . " They 're all booked , " he said .

NW	place . " Farrell 's phone calls to her mother pointed directly to her killer . That was a good thing : The doorman could n't remember the killer 's face and a video surveillance unit was n't working that night . Police tracked down Wadatz , who admitted to one of the most brutal murders and rapes in Clearwater 's recent memory . Farrell was stabbed 33 times . Many of the wounds were to the face and neck . After she fell to the floor , Wadatz raped her . He washed off in Farrell 's shower , then dressed in her red shorts and white tank top . He put his clothes and the knife in a plastic bag . Wadatz left without the doorman noticing his change of dress . He dumped the bloody clothes and knife near the Belleair Causeway . After his confession , Clearwater police booked Wadatz on a first-degree murder charge . Prosecutors decided to seek the death penalty . Mrs. Farrell said she wanted just a little funeral for her daughter , but CIS got involved in the arrangements , moved the service to a bigger room and added an honor guard to the ceremony . She was grateful . Then the apartment complex , which has since been sold and converted to condominiums , got pushy about getting her to move her daughter 's things out , she said . Mrs. Farrell said the complex 's agents threatened to keep the security deposit because of all the blood . She eventually got the deposit back , but her anger was rising . As she emptied her daughter 's apartment , people walked by and made ghostly noises , she said . Then she saw the doorman goofing off with his girlfriend . " I 'm thinking everybody in this building is in danger . They 've just had a killing and it 's still happening , " she said . " They can throw their fancy funerals , but they ca n't tighten up their security ? " A few months later , Wadatz offered to plead guilty and accepted a sentence of life in prison without the chance of parole . Mrs. Farrell agreed to avoid the stress of a trial . She has since learned that Wadatz is seeking an appeal , which makes her angry . But she has just as much anger for CIS. " I blame him , but it 's like blaming the devil , " she said . " But these people , they just did n't do their job . I blame them as much as I blame him because they failed her that night . " Mrs. Farrell also sued the apartment complex , Trammel Crow Residential Services and the doorman . Her attorneys , Tom Carey and Jodi Leisure , think all of them shared blame . " We thought the security was inadequate and was sort of a patchwork quilt , " Carey said . In court papers , defense attorneys suggested Farrell was at fault . " She was a bright girl who made some mistakes in judgment , that 's what it comes down to , " Poulin said . " But what 20-year-old has n't ? The person ultimately to blame is not Aimee . The person to blame is Todd Wadatz . " On Dec. 14 , nearly four years to the day after Aimee Farrell 's death , the lawsuit was settled . The terms are confidential and the defendants admit no wrongdoing . Poulin said CIS has changed no policies because of this case .
NW	The lawyer for Joseph L. Druce , charged with killing a former priest who was being held for pedophile acts , said Sunday that he hopes to convince jurors that Druce was insane when he allegedly choked and beat the priest , a convicted pedophile , to death in a state prison two years ago . Druce 's trial is scheduled to start Monday with jury selection in Worcester Superior Court . Druce is accused in the August 2003 killing of John Geoghan , the former priest . Geoghan was serving a 9- to-10-year sentence for having groped a 10-year-old boy . The two men were placed in the same protective custody unit at the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley , where Druce , who was serving a life sentence for another murder , allegedly strangled Geoghan and then is reported to have stomped on his body . " We believe that he has a major mental illness that prevented him from being able to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law , " Druce 's lawyer , John H. LaChance of Framingham , said in a telephone interview Sunday . The Worcester district attorney , John J. Conte , could not be reached for comment Sunday . Prosecutors have charged Druce with first-degree murder and have said he carefully plotted to kill Geoghan . LaChance has said his client 's public outbursts during a pretrial hearing showed his explosive mental state . The Cape and Islands district attorney , Michael O'Keefe , said that it is generally difficult to convince a jury to acquit accused murderers on the basis of insanity . " Those people who commit an offense while meeting the legal test of insanity , theoretically , should be acquitted of the offense , " he said . " But they should also be put in a position where they are no longer a threat of society ... Unfortunately , people do not trust that judges will keep them locked up . " LaChance acknowledged the challenge of obtaining an acquittal by reason of insanity but said he is confident the jury will be swayed by Druce 's past as an abuse victim . Druce sent a letter to The Boston Globe last week outlining a plan that the Department of Correction punish imprisoned sex offenders who engage in "lewd and lascivious conversations regarding their sexual activities , past , present , and future . " " This policy should be mandated in order to prevent sex offenders from sharing their 'sick ' experiences ... and to stop their planning future rapes , molestations and the like on innocent men , women and children , " Druce wrote in his the three-page proposal sent to the Globe . Diane Wiffin , a Department of Correction spokeswoman , declined to say Sunday in a telephone interview whether the agency would consider adopting the idea . " We 're not going to comment on anything he might have to say , " she said . LaChance said that he had not seen Druce 's letter , but that he believed it was related to his client 's allegations that he had overheard Geoghan talking about his experiences as a sex offender . " What it does is it goes back to some evidence that will be introduced that Geoghan was talking with others about his sexual conduct and what he was going to do when he got out , " LaChance said . LaChance said he plans to introduce witnesses , including prisoners , guards , and a psychiatrist , who will testify about the circumstances of Geoghan 's death and Druce 's state of mind . " I think that once they 've heard the story of his life basically , the history of abuse , ... that the background for the whole thing will substantiate the mental illness that he has , " he said . LaChance declined to elaborate on the abuse Druce allegedly suffered . But Druce has disclosed many details about the alleged abuse on his website , which features pictures of himself as a child and as an adult and pointers on how to recognize potential child abusers . In a lengthy entry entitled " This is Josephs ' Story , " Druce said teenagers sexually abused him when he was 8 or 9 years old at a residential school in which he was placed . Then , he said , he was abused by an older man , who plied him with alcohol and marijuana before raping him . Druce was convicted of killing a man in 1989 and was imprisoned at maximum-security Souza-Baranowski . In April 2003 , Geoghan was transferred from medium-security Concord State prison to Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center , which is part of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Shirley . On Aug. 23 , 2003 , Druce allegedly followed Geoghan into his cell , jammed the door shut , then killed him . The death sparked calls for a sweeping review of state prisons , including an examination of assignments . The department now reviews prisoner assignments carefully and has developed guidelines for placing prisoners in protective custody , Wiffin said . " This is an agency in reform , " she said . But Leslie Walker , executive director of the prisoners ' rights advocacy group Massachusetts Correctional Legal Services , said the state has more to do . " Many people ... feel that [Geoghan 's ] death was preventable , " she said . " Unfortunately , it 's only when someone dies that there is enough attention drawn that reform can occur .

NW	The Rev. Jon de Cortina Garaigorta , a Jesuit priest who dedicated the last decade to searching for the missing children of El Salvador 's brutal civil war , died in mid-December , officials of his organization said Wednesday . He was 71. They said the cause was complications of a stroke . The founder of the independent Association for Missing Children , de Cortina is credited with using basic detective work , then later DNA testing , to solve the disappearances of about 310 children . Sandra Lobo , the coordinator of the group , said it had reunited 178 of those children with their parents . At least 50 of them had been adopted by unsuspecting Americans , she said . De Cortina 's mission began in 1992 , when the war had ended and the U.N. Truth Commission opened investigations into widespread human rights abuses during the war . In the Chalatenango region , a handful of rural peasants came forward with testimony about how their children had been kidnapped by government troops . That led de Cortina to begin his search . Word of his search spread across the country , bringing hundreds of reports of abducted children , as well as confessions from soldiers . They told him the kidnappings had been meant not only to terrorize supporters of the Marxist rebel group but also to raise money by selling the children to corrupt adoption agencies . The Salvadoran military publicly acknowledged that families had been separated during the war , but always maintained that its officers had acted on the impulse to save children who had been abandoned or orphaned in fighting that left 75,000 people dead or missing . " These children were robbed , abducted in the countryside by the military for a variety of motives , " de Cortina said in a 1996 interview with The New York Times after the first few dozen missing children had been found and reunited with their families . " But we believe that the right to recover their identity , and the right of their families to know the fate of the children they lost , must be fulfilled and respected . " Born in 1934 in Bilbao , Spain , de Cortina joined the Society of Jesus in 1954 , moved to El Salvador a year later and was ordained in 1968 . He studied philosophy and civil engineering at St . Louis University , in Missouri , and theology in Frankfurt , Germany . He later became a professor of seismic engineering at the Jesuit-run Universidad Centroamericana . During the war , even after six of his Jesuit colleagues were killed by a secret military unit and Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero was assassinated during a Mass , de Cortina remained an outspoken critic of the systematic abuses by the Salvadoran military , which had been trained and financed by the United States . A month before he died , his work in El Salvador was recognized with St . Louis University 's highest honor , the Sword of Ignatius Loyola . " Instead of being frightened by the conflict around him , he became a tireless and articulate advocate for disclosing the atrocities that took place during the war , " said Lawrence Biondi , president of St . Louis University . " He was the voice for the voiceless . "
NW	With the Lightning continuing its frustrating win-a-few , lose-a-few ways and showing no signs of snapping back into a Stanley Cup contender any time soon , general manager Jay Feaster has three options : 1 . Stand pat . Ride it out . Hope the boys come around . 2. Tinker with it . Try a couple of minor deals . Hope the stars come around . 3. Blow it up . Wheel and deal . Make a few blockbuster trades . Here 's a vote for the first option , even if it means getting knocked out in the first round of the playoffs or missing the postseason entirely . In fact , suggesting the first option is not a vote of confidence for this team . The way the Lightning is playing , standing pat might mean the same as forgetting about any parades in downtown Tampa in June . The problem Feaster faces is the Lightning is so out of sorts in every area of the game , it 's hard to zone in on what area to fix . It is n't as if there is one hole that needs patched and , boom , the Lightning is the team to beat again . The goaltending has been inconsistent . The defense looks slow . The star forwards have too many invisible nights . The special teams are anything but special . And the grinders and pluggers work their tails off like they are supposed to but rarely show up on the score sheet . It 's a mess . And there is no magic solution out there . Okay , for argument 's sake , blame the goaltending . The best solutions likely are Minnesota 's Manny Fernandez and Dwayne Roloson and ( maybe ) Washington 's Olaf Kolzig . Maybe any of the three is an upgrade over what the Lightning has now , but none of the three is so proven that he 'll assure the Lightning gets deep into the playoffs . Considering it likely would take a name player ( Fredrik Modin ? Pavel Kubina ? ) to get one of those guys , the Lightning is better off taking its chances with John Grahame and Sean Burke . Even if , say , Fernandez could give you a good ride , another consideration is that all three available goalies are unrestricted free agents after the season . The defense certainly needs another body , preferably one with a little speed . But what would it cost and is it going to push the Lightning over the top ? A differencemaker on defense is rarely traded midseason because he is such a valuable commodity . As far as the scorers go , coach John Tortorella is right when he says the Lightning has too many talented scorers to continue struggling offensively . But make no mistake , the Lightning simply is n't going through a slump . This is who it is and , right now , it is not a serious Cup player . Because it 's so hard , however , to pull off major trades during the season now because of the salary cap , Feaster 's options are severely limited . That 's why he is better off riding it out and retooling in the offseason , when the options through trades and free agency are much greater . Plus , he must consider what could happen with his free agents : Grahame , Kubina , Brad Richards , Cory Sarich and Ruslan Fedotenko , among the key ones . One little addition is n't going to solve the Lightning 's problems . And unless the Lightning trades its entire team for Ottawa 's entire team , a blockbuster likely wo n't turn the Lightning into a Cup contender again either . Lightning diehards like to point out that the 2003-04 Cup team stumbled and bumbled through the first half of the season , too , and then flipped the switch . This , however , is not the 2003-04 Lightning . But it does have a good core and does n't need a complete overhaul . In fact , the Lightning has so many special players ( Richards , Marty St . Louis , Vinny Lecavalier , for example ) that a few well-planned changes could make it the best team in the league again . But such changes need careful planning , and Feaster should not rush into a quick-fix trade that will get the Lightning a few more victories this season at the expense of a lot of victories in the future . The clock is not ticking on the Lightning . This is n't a do-or-die season . The Lightning 's window of being a contender remains wide open for a few more seasons . The best thing to do is be patient . Even if you know deep down that 2005-06 is not going to be the Lightning 's season .
NW	ATLANTA - Craig Smith thought there was no worse feeling in the world than when he fouled out of Boston College 's 57-54 loss to Georgia Tech in the second round of the NCAA Tournament two years ago . Smith walked off the court at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee a picture of absolute dejection after he had scored a mere 2 points in 22 foul-plagued minutes . But this ? " This is a feeling that 's even worse , " said Smith , whose game-high 26 points ( on 10-for-13 shooting from the field , including a one-handed runner with 1.3 seconds left for his first 3-pointer of the season ) went for naught in BC 's 60-58 Atlantic Coast Conference loss to the Yellow Jackets yesterday before an Alexander Memorial Coliseum sellout crowd of 9,191 . " You try to do everything you can and , obviously , you come up with a loss , " Smith said after the 11th-ranked Eagles dropped to 11-3 overall and 0-2 in ACC play . BC lost its first conference game at Maryland , 73-71 , Dec. 11 . " I feel bad . I kind of fault myself down the stretch . Obviously , I had a chance to put us up . " Smith , who scored BC 's last 10 points of the game , was referring to the opportunity he had to give his team the lead when he stepped to the foul line ( where the Eagles converted 10 of 19 overall ) with the Eagles trailing , 55-54 , with 55.5 seconds left . Smith clanged his first offering , blowing BC 's chance to take control of the lead , but made his second to preserve a tie . But Georgia Tech wrested it away when Anthony Morrow ( 15 points ) drove baseline , pulled up after getting hemmed in by several BC defenders , and kicked it out to the perimeter where Zam Fredrick ( 7 points ) knocked down a clutch trey that made it 58-55 with 33.5 seconds left . After Louis Hinnant saved the Eagles from coming up empty on a loose-ball scrum by calling timeout with 12.8 seconds left as Smith battled on the floor for possession , Jared Dudley ( 14 points , 7 rebounds ) inbounded the ball , putting it in the hands of freshman guard Tyrese Rice ( 10 points ) , who hesitated for a second on a contested 3-point shot from the corner that missed its mark and fell into the waiting hands of Georgia Tech 's Jeremis Smith ( 16 points , 9 rebounds ) . " Georgia Tech did a good job of taking it to us physically , particularly the first 20 minutes , " said BC coach Al Skinner , whose team trailed at intermission , 29-26 , after the Eagles hit just 10 of 19 field goals ( 1 of 9 from the 3-point arc ) and were outrebounded , 18-9 ( 33-23 overall ) . " We did n't respond particularly well , I did n't think . " In the second half , I thought we did a better job with that . [Georgia Tech ] worked their tails off , they rebounded the crap out of the basketball , and they hustled and I thought they played a great ball game . " This from a Georgia Tech team projected to finish ninth ( of 12 teams ) in the ACC 's preseason media poll and had barely a recognizable name or face ( with the notable exception of coach Paul Hewitt ) from the squad that got past BC two years ago in the NCAA tourney and advanced to the Final Four in San Antonio . " This certainly is an important win , " Hewitt said after his team improved to 8-4 (2-0 ACC) . " Any time you have a home game in the ACC , you almost have to win . " After the Eagles went almost 11:05 between Dudley baskets , a span that bridged the halves , the second half seemed to offer little promise for BC when the Yellow Jackets twice led by as many as 8 on Morrow 's 3-point burial ( 34-26 ) and Jeremis Smith 's contorted layup underneath the basket ( 43-35 ) . The Eagles came out of a timeout with 11:34 to go and immediately responded when Hinnant stepped out for a 3-pointer that pulled BC within 43-38. Smith then scored on a strong layup and Rice followed with a leaning lane floater that , somehow , found its mark to pull the Eagles within 45-42 . Rice went to the line ( courtesy of Jeremis Smith 's third personal ) , but only made the first of two foul shot attempts to cut Georgia Tech 's lead to 45-43 . Rice , however , atoned when he buried a huge trey for the Eagles that gave them a 46-45 lead with 7:59 left . It was the first lead BC had enjoyed since 21-18 , but that was before D'Andre Bell tied it , 21-21 , with a 3-pointer . The Yellow Jackets wrested the lead away , 48-46 , when Morrow buried a trifecta from the corner with seven minutes left . Rice hoisted a trey and induced Fredrick to commit his first personal , but the BC freshman missed a chance to give the Eagles the lead when he made the first and last of his three attempts to tie the game , at 48 . A clutch catch-and-shoot trey by freshman guard Lewis Clinch put the Eagles on their heels , 53-50 , and set into motion a turn of events that led to their second ACC setback . " Starting off with two games on the road in the ACC , that 's how it is , " Dudley said . " Two heartbreakers , two losses , but no one is going to feel sorry for us . This is how you 've got to do it ; you 've got to be able to bounce back and respond to the challenge . " Obviously , we 've got N.C . State at home [tomorrow ] and we 're a pretty good home team , so hopefully we can get one . "
NW	You can have fun with the 215-horsepower car -- just not as much . The Crossfire itself is based on the Mercedes-Benz C-class chassis and is closely related to the Mercedes SLK roadster , which of course costs a lot more . It 's also closely related to the CLK , which uses the same vehicle architecture and the same drivetrain as the Crossfire . The car is not built by Chrysler . It is manufactured in Germany by Karmann , and it represents the first major sharing of technology and parts with Mercedes-Benz since its parent , Daimler Benz , bought Chrysler Corp. to create DaimlerChrysler . The base Crossfire comes with either a six-speed manual or five-speed Autostick automatic transmission , both from other Mercedes products . Our SRT6 , though , came with the automatic , which is the only transmission offered in the high-powered version . This seems a bit odd , considering that most people looking for a true performance car would prefer a manual gearbox . The Autostick does allow for manual shifting of the automatic , however , but you do n't have to use a clutch . Although the Crossfire is very German in its construction and manners , its styling is all-American , having come from the Chrysler design studios . It 's a low-slung sports car in the tradition of a Corvette , with an eye-catching sculptured appearance , aggressive front end and severely sloped rear end . And if you liked the coupe , you 're going to love the convertible . It 's quite beautiful , especially with the top down . The power top opens and closes by holding down a button on the center console between the driver and passenger after the center roof latch is released . You do n't have to worry about lowering the windows first -- the power-top switch lowers them for you before the top starts to move . And when you close the top , the windows close automatically if you keep the button depressed after the top moves to the closed position . Our test vehicle , which unfortunately was n't the convertible model , came with a long list of standard equipment . Among the safety features are side air bags , four-wheel disc antilock brakes with electronic brake assist , traction control , electronic stability control and even a tire pressure monitoring system . Inside , the car had dual-zone climate control , heated power front seats , leather seats and steering wheel , security system with alarm , tilt/telescopic steering column , universal garage/gate opener , cruise control , power windows with one-touch down and up , and power door locks with a central locking switch and remote control . Graphite metallic clear-coat paint was on the exterior of our car , and it matched nicely with the dark , slate gray leather interior . The car has great curb appeal , even without the amazing performance . Everywhere I took it , people gawked at it , and some came up and asked about it . Even though the Crossfire has been on the market for a while , it 's still a vehicle that most people have never seen . The SRT6 's EPA fuel economy ratings are decent for a performance vehicle such as this : 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway . Of course , to get
NW	In " Time of the Wolf , " an apocalyptic disaster movie by Michael Haneke , a group of survivors chides a woman for her lack of compassion . " Compassion , " she responds . " Compassion is a luxury I ca n't afford ! " It 's hard to come by in the rest of Haneke 's films , too . But for all the talk of the Austrian director being a doomsaying cinematic lord , his recent work is concerned , in various ways , with the present struggle between civility and savagery . His movies are dark because the world is dark . Haneke 's early work suggested a filmmaker out to harass his audience by condemning it for watching his movies - " Benny 's Video " ( 1992 ) centered on a boy inspired to kill after seeing footage of a pig 's slaughter . Haneke gave intellectuals fodder for knotty considerations of a paradox between representations of violence and its real-world consequences . To others , his movies could seem loathsomely high-minded . When the director started making films in French , however , beginning in 2000 with " Code Unknown , " he began exploring a society 's conflict with itself . The result has been a string of masterpieces that operate with keen restraint and a vulnerability no one could have predicted based on his early work . The characters push each other 's buttons , the filmmaker does n't . It 's a strategy that immediately distinguishes him from , say , Lars von Trier , who uses people as marionettes that do his ideological bidding . That Haneke puts people before ideology accounts for the emotional power that deepens his movies . His work is hotly intelligent , and it does n't pretend to have solutions . Haneke deals with subjects that do n't have any . Here 's a quick guide to some of his movies available on video and DVD. " Funny Games " ( 1997 ) A German couple ( Susanne Lothar , Ulrich MÃ¼he ) and their young son head out to their lovely lakeside country house , where they 're taken hostage and tortured by two young punks ( Arno Frisch , Frank Giering ) . This is the most blatantly self-aware of all Haneke 's films : violence that purports to deconstruct violence . But Lothar and MÃ¼he 's anguish and the killers ' jokey sadism elevate an intellectual exercise into a cruel theater of absurdity : People do n't kill people ; ideas do . " Code Unknown " ( 2000 ) The subtitle is " Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys , " but the film 's disjointed structure is completely emotional . As with most of Haneke 's movies , the subject - here , social disconnection - does n't declare itself . We 're shown an angry heterogeneous society : dozens of cultures tossed into a pot whose contents refuse to melt . One scene set on a subway car , featuring Juliette Binoche ( who plays a minor actress ) and a cocky young Arab , says more about a country 's racial woes than all 113 minutes of " Crash . " " The Piano Teacher " ( 2001 ) This exhausting adaptation of Elfriede Jelinek 's novel about a severe musician ( Isabelle Huppert ) is a case study of a sexual psychosis . Haneke shocks us but holds the sensationalism : The director sympathetically finds this woman as disturbed as she is disturbing . When the teacher succumbs to the advances of a student ( Benoit Magimel ) and is betrayed , we understand that Haneke wants to see her set free from her disorder . The picture builds to a chilling conclusion , and Huppert , with her pale , dead face , gives a performance for the ages . " Time of the Wolf " ( 2003 ) The least discussed and appreciated of Haneke 's recent releases . A family of four ( Huppert plays Mom ) finds their country home occupied by gun-toting strangers . Papa is shot , and the survivors are cast out into an unexplained society-wide disaster . The movie gives us various philosophical ideas ( there 's a shabby capitalist commune and men selling water on horseback ) but ultimately it 's both a cautionary tale and a lean parable of Third World strife .

NW	If you want to point fingers after the Panthers ' public stoning of the Giants , there 's one problem : The good Lord provides us with only 10 fingers . But on a playoff Sunday when the Giants were shut out for the first time in nearly 10 years , Tiki Barber lent an index finger -- and fingered his coaches . Yes , the face of the franchise , the All-Milky-Way running back with the omni- present smile who rarely has a cross word for anyone and surely helps doddering grandmothers cross the Lower Eastside 's streets , did n't give Giants coaches the same free pass . Barber said of the Panthers , " I do n't think they were more physical . I think in some ways we were outcoached . " Asked about Plaxico Burress 's not catching a pass Sunday , Barber replied that was " just a testament that our game plan was n't the right one . " The Giants erred by not using quicker ball snaps on running plays , he said , which allowed additional Carolina defenders to crowd the box when the Giants lined up in running formations . " Whereas when we were going on quick sounds we were effective , " Barber said . " We were getting 4 or 5 yards per play . But I think we played into their scheme and it ended up ultimately costing us this game . ... We were n't able to adjust when we got eight and nine guys in the box and our running game was stifled . " The Giants were prepared for the game , Barber said , but he also praised Panthers coach John Fox before and after criticizing his own coaches . Barber may be the most media-savvy pro athlete alive , so when he reproaches his coaches yet says Fox is a "great defensive coordinator and they had a great scheme and a great plan for us and we could n't adjust to it , " the message might as well be spelled out in Day-Glo green , so easy it is to decode . But someone offered Barber a trapdoor through which to escape , if he wished , to soften his stance , noting " not a lot of teams moved the ball real well on this defense . Do you think you might be a little too hard on the coaching staff ? " " No... , " he replied . Would n't you love to be a fly on the wall when Tom Coughlin asks Barber why he 's providing public job evaluations of the guys for whom Barber works ? But Barber is at least partly right . The Giants lost for myriad reasons , including their being outcoached . These teams possessed equal talent yet played a shockingly lopsided game that the Giants lost at home . A loss you could accept . Carolina , to its credit , "played the closest we 've come to mistake-free football since I 've been here , " said defensive tackle Brentson Buckner , who joined the Panthers in 2001 . When that happens , you 'll lose nearly every time . The Panthers made the Giants offense one-dimensional by controlling the line of scrimmage , so Barber ran into spaces as small as keyholes . The Panthers ' offensive line mangled the Giants for 223 rushing yards at 5 yards a pop and possessed the ball for nearly 43 minutes , one of the most astounding and telling stats you 'll see . And Eli Manning proved once and for all the hype has exceeded his performance , throwing interceptions in the second half on three consecutive possessions . Though everyone is loath to say so , he regressed when he should have been improving . At this stage in his career , he 's in the bottom third of starting NFL quarterbacks because of erroneous decisions and throws such as those on Sunday . " You ca n't put it on him . It was a team loss , " center Shaun O'Hara said . " The important thing is to not point fingers . There 's an old saying : ' Make a fist and all the fingers point back at you . " ' But the next time Coughlin and Barber speak , which may already have happened , voices may rise and fingers might wag and point -- at each other . (E-mail : bettkin@timesunion.com . )
NW	Proponents of the all-Alaska natural gas project say one reason for backing their proposed pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez is to avoid running the line through Canada to reach Lower 48 markets . They say you just ca n't trust what our hockey-playing neighbors might do . They could decide to tax our gas , or change the rules for pipeline construction or operation . Or take some of the construction jobs . And what if Canada had a snit and threatened to stop the flow of gas ? Well , you can set aside that paranoia for a minute . No matter what you may think of our neighbors , at least they never drew up a war plan to attack us . Too bad the United States ca n't say the same thing . The Washington Post reported last week that the U.S. military approved a secret plan in 1930 to invade , conquer and take over Canada -- just in case . It seems the plan started in the late 1920s as a precaution -- just in case we got into a trade war with England and needed to take down Canada before the British could use it to launch attacks on U.S. soil . Maybe Canadians 125 years ago -- when they first sang the words to " O Canada " -- had a hint that goofy Pentagon planners might someday look north and see a target . The last line of the song , which later became the national anthem , is : " O Canada , we stand on guard for thee . " The bottom line : It 's a good thing Canadians have a sense of humor about Americans . Anchorage Daily News editorial
NW	Cox News Service JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon began breathing on his own Monday as doctors began to revive him from a coma . But chances remained slim that Sharon , 77 , would return to public office after his massive stroke , they said . Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef , director-general of Hadassah Hospital , told reporters that Sharon moved his right arm and leg in response to stimulation . The response constitutes a "very important " sign of reliable brain function , but doctors still do not know if Sharon , who remains connected to life-support systems , has retained substantial cognitive abilities , Mor-Yosef said . Sharon has not yet opened his eyes or regained consciousness five days after suffering the stroke . His chief surgeon , Felix Umansky , said that the leader remains in critical condition and that it is too soon to say that he was out of danger . " The moment that the prime minister is able to talk to us and to sit up one can say there will no longer be danger to his life , " he said . At the entrance to the hospital Monday , the Associated Press reported , three Jerusalemites hung up a white sheet with blue lettering in English and Hebrew that read , " Ariel Sharon , there is more to do , please wake up . " Doctors performed three brain operations to stem hemorrhaging in Sharon 's brain after his stroke Wednesday night . He had been in a medically induced coma since Thursday as a way to allow his body to heal from some of the trauma . Umansky said that it would take up to two days to fully revive Sharon from the coma and for doctors to evaluate his mental and physical functions . Meanwhile , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas confirmed that Palestinian parliamentary elections would take place as scheduled Jan . 25 . He urged his people to participate in the vote . Abbas said that the White House had assured him that Palestinians would be able to vote in the Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem , despite previous Israeli threats to prohibit the balloting . " With this situation , there is nothing preventing the elections from going ahead , " he told a televised news conference scheduled on the eve of the Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha . " I call on the Palestinian people to take part in the shaping of democracy so we can prove to the world that we deserve this democracy . " Israel views Jerusalem as its undisputed capital , but portions of the city captured by Israel in the 1967 war have substantial Arab populations . Palestinians want to make Jerusalem part of a future state . Abbas , also known as Abu Mazen , had said he would cancel the ballot if the more than 120,000 Palestinians eligible to vote were not allowed . Israel said it would forbid them in response to the fact that the Islamic group Hamas is running in the election . Abbas ' political party Fatah is expected to win the polls despite an expected strong showing by Hamas . ( Story can end here ; optional material follows . ) Israel 's public security minister , Gideon Ezra , said that Israel would allow campaigning in Jerusalem as long as candidates register first with police and do not belong to militant groups . " Only those who do n't represent extremist groups will receive permission , " Ezra told Israel Radio . Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the White House for its campaign of suicide bombings against Israelis . However , its candidates are a mix of mainly social workers , teachers and charity officials who have made a career of helping needy Palestinians . Abbas , in the news conference , appealed to Palestinian militant groups to emulate Hamas and stick to the pact reached among them last spring to end attacks against Israel . " The hudna (ceasefire with Israel ) must continue in 2006 ; it is a gift we are giving to our people , " he said . Margaret Coker 's e-mail address is mcoker@coxnews.com
NW	I generally support the separation of stage and state . I do n't want to hear John Ashcroft or Orrin Hatch sing , and I do n't want to hear Barbra Streisand or Toby Keith expound on politics . But some artists earn the right to be taken ( relatively ) seriously when they take a political stand . Way back when they were teenagers , Bono and U2 already were recording intelligent songs that went beyond the usual platitudes about war and peace , racism and religion . I 'm not sure Bono deserved to be Time 's 2005 person of the year ( along with Bill and Melinda Gates ) , but he has done his homework on important but mind-numbing issues such as international debt in the developing world . And , when necessary , he has been willing to sublimate his ego to suck up to everyone from the pope to Jesse Helms when he felt he needed their help . Yet something about Bono 's humanitarian efforts - maybe the Geraldo-like preening and pomposity he can bring to them - drives some people crazy . " There are probably more annoying things than being hectored about African development by a wealthy Irish rock star in a cowboy hat , " Paul Theroux wrote in a recent New York Times column , " but I ca n't think of one at the moment . " Hmmm . What could be more annoying ? Maybe a self-promoting travel writer 's over-the-top complaints about Bono 's charitable work ? Theroux does make some reasonable points . Money alone wo n't solve Africa 's problems unless it is accompanied by political reform within the continent and economic justice in the developed world 's dealings with Africa 's governments and people . But what would Theroux have Bono do ? Organize a militia and overthrow the government of Burundi ? The recent Live 8 concerts , organized by Bob Geldof , Bono and other performers to publicize their push for reforms in G8 governments ' policies on AIDS and poverty in the Third World , actually represented a relatively sophisticated understanding of geopolitics . They may not produce more tangible benefits than earlier , more naive charity efforts did , but they could n't possibly be as "wasteful ... stupid and harmful " as Theroux claimed . I agree with Theroux on this much : When I listen to music , I do n't particularly care to be lectured about the war in Iraq or the plight of the family farm . U2 's Pride ( In the Name of Love ) is a great song , but it would be great if it were about Martin St . Louis instead of Martin Luther King Jr. And its transcendent moment comes when Bono shuts up and the rhythm section kicks in . At Live 8 , the most memorable anthems were performed by a reunited Pink Floyd ( Comfortably Numb ) and a reunited Who , or at least a befuddled Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey ( Won't Get Fooled Again ) . " The child is grown , the dream is gone " and "meet the new boss - same as the old boss " are n't exactly inspirational calls to action on behalf of starving Africans or anybody else . So how seriously should be we taking Willie Nelson and Kinky ( no relation ) Friedman ? I 'm not jumping on the BioWillie bandwagon just yet . I admire Nelson 's good intentions on issues from Farm Aid to alternative fuel , but I do n't get the sense he is quite as well versed on current events as Bono is . Maybe it 's the french fry fumes . As for the Kinkster : He 's much better qualified to be governor ( but much less famous ) than Jesse Ventura or Arnold Schwarzenegger were when they were elected . ( Whether he 's better qualified than George W. Bush was when he first ran is arguable , but he has exactly as much experience in public office as Bush did . ) Kinky is a true son of Texas , a former Peace Corps volunteer with a genuine empathy for his state 's neediest residents . His family 's Echo Hill Ranch outside Kerrville has long been an oasis for troubled kids ( as his nearby Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch is for stray and unwanted animals ) , and he ( like Bush before him ) speaks persuasively about issues such as education and immigration . Even some of Kinky 's old songs with the Texas Jewboys were more serious than they first sounded . Ride 'Em , Jewboy is a tribute to victims of the Holocaust , and Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed posits a revisionist view of women 's liberation . Whether all that translates into a serious candidacy is uncertain . Kinky is raising a fair amount of money and doing well in the polls . Incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Perry is broadly unpopular , and the Democrats are in their usual disarray . On the other hand , Kinky has been known to introduce his old friend and traveling companion " Jewford " to political audiences as "very possibly the next first lady of the state of Texas . " The state that gave us Tom DeLay and Dick Armey may not be ready for a serious candidate who does n't take himself too seriously .
NW	Cox News Service GRAND JUNCTION , Colo . -- A few new memories : Our older girl , age 5 , has decided my wife and I need some help raising our 2-year-old , and we 're not embarrassed to admit she 's sometimes better at parenting her sister than we are . Sometimes our younger girl wo n't eat , which can lead to bad moods and delayed or shortened sleep. One night , faced with this situation , Lisa and I resorted to our usual bag of tricks , which involves coercion , threats , deception and begging . Seeing this was n't working , our older girl offered this bit of information to her sister : " The potatoes hate the meat , " she said , " so put some potato in your mouth and it will chase the meat down your throat . " I 've used that line many times since then . I have no idea where my daughter might have heard it , or if she made it up herself . Some of my heroes are liars ... of a sort . Harper Lee . Stephen King . J.K. Rowling . Dr. Seuss . These people and others like them make a living making up stories loved by millions . If you ca n't be such a person yourself , would n't it be nice to be the parent of one ? And if you are such a lucky parent , how do you learn to recognize when a "lie " is good and when it might be an indicator of something insidious ? For now , I 've decided a great big smile means something positive is happening . That 's what I saw on our 2-year-old 's face last week when she told me about a death-defying feat . The story sprung from an everyday event : A trip to a lake with her mother and sister to feed the geese . The girls stood too close to the water for Lisa 's comfort , so she told them to back away or they might fall in . The girls obeyed by backing away , then they got close again . So Lisa made them sit down . Shortly afterward , they walked around the lake . Our 2-year-old decided to spice up the tale a bit that night at dinner . She told me about being too close to the water and then , in an apparent moment of inspiration , made up something new . " I got too close to the water , " she said ( basically ) , " then I fell IN the water and started swimming all around the water . " Her arms pumped as she mimicked swimming and her smile grew and grew in proportion with the bright pink shade her face turned . Flabbergasted , all I could think to do was laugh . Mommy 's eyes and mouth were both open wide , in a good way . Sweetheart , I asked , was n't the water cold ? No answer , just a bigger smile . We 're going to be in big trouble when she develops a poker face . If there 's a cheesy movie you loved when you were a kid , there 's a good chance your own kids will get a kick out of it . Our daughters have enjoyed " Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory , " the campy 1966 big-screen version of the " Batman " TV show with Adam West and , particularly , " The Wizard of Oz . " Over the weekend , I served up the ultimate cheese : " King Kong vs. Godzilla . " The fuss over the current " Kong " remake has led to older films about the character being re-released to home video , including the two made by Toho , the studio responsible for Godzilla and many other giant rubber-suit monsters , and I rented it . The movie has a giant , fire-breathing reptile , a giant gorilla and a giant , land-walking octopus . Homes are smashed and tanks are melted . It 's got everything a kid could want . Well , maybe everything a boy could want , but my girls were less than enthralled . Aside from the 2-year-old slapping her belly while Kong beat his chest on screen , they largely lost interest about halfway through and I suspect they only stuck with it to humor me .

NW	Cox News Service ATLANTA -- Barely four months into its bankruptcy case , Delta Air Lines has a new judge to deal with - at least temporarily . equal dollops of humor and sarcasm to the airline 's Chapter 11 proceedings so far - has stepped aside for medical reasons , according to the federal bankruptcy court in New York . She was slowed by sciatica and two knee replacements . She 'll be replaced by Judge Adlai S. Hardin Jr. , 68 , who a former clerk described as a "very no-nonsense kind of guy " who runs an efficient courtroom . Beatty 's leave initially will be for two months , according to court officials , but Delta 's case could stay with Hardin even after Beatty 's leave ends if he handles several issues during her absence . " We anticipate a seamless transition , " said Delta spokesman Anthony Black . Lawyers and other people involved with the case said the change will likely slow proceedings initially . But they added that it should n't be disruptive over the long run because a bankruptcy case involves numerous discrete issues and hearings rather than a long , complicated trial . " I do n't anticipate that it will result in significant delays , " said Atlanta attorney Darryl Laddin , who has appeared before Beatty many times but few times before Hardin . " It can be difficult for a judge to step into the middle of a case , but it 's done , " he said . Laddin predicted Hardin , who is also taking on another of Beatty 's cases , will "get up to speed quickly " and may be able to spend longer days in court than Beatty . Beatty 's key rulings so far have involved retiree and pilot issues , but the judge in a large case like Delta 's also referees dozens of claims involving aircraft leases and other creditors . Ultimately , the judge must approve a plan of reorganization for Delta to emerge from Chapter 11 . The airline filed for Chapter 11 protection in the Manhattan court on Sept. 14 . Former clerk Josephine Yang-Patyi described Hardin as a gentlemanly , by-the-book judge . " He is all about getting things done in the most efficient way possible and the fastest way , " she said Monday . Hence , court sessions could stretch late into the night . " He does n't like delays . He does n't like excuses , " Yang-Patyi said , adding later : " There are litigants who just buy time . He does n't like that . " Hardin is a distant relative of the late Adlai Stevenson , a twice-failed presidential candidate in the 1950s . His father , Adlai Stevenson Hardin , was an ad executive who became a full-time sculptor . Hardin spent much of his career at the prominent firm Milbank , Tweed , Hadley &amp; McCloy before moving to the bench about 10 years ago . A graduate of Columbia 's law school , he joined the firm after a short stint on active duty in the Army , then did a range of commercial litigation , including antitrust and bankruptcy cases . As a judge , one of his biggest cases was a bankruptcy filing by NextWave Telecom , a company licensed to provide wireless service in New York City and other areas . He moved to stop the Federal Communications Commission from revoking NextWave 's licenses , an issue that eventually was ruled on by the U.S. Supreme Court , which decided the FCC had overstepped its authority . Hardin sought and listened to the opinions of his clerks and interns , according to both Yang-Patyi and Jonathan Koevary , a former intern who is now a bankruptcy attorney in New York . " He is a very intellectual guy , a very fair guy , " Koevary said . " He let 's everybody speak . " Jim Gray , chairman of a retired pilots group , fears the midstream switch could disrupt the case . " I do n't know how you bring somebody in and bring them up to speed on a case of this magnitude , " he said . " Now it 's like starting over on a lot of things . " He said Beatty , 63 , has "gotten a lot done " despite health problems that limited her schedule . Beatty often started hearings late and limited most to three or four hours per day . Still , Gray said Beatty appeared visibly weaker last week at the latest Delta hearing . Beatty became known as much for colorful ruminations as for rulings . Her periodic digressions - which sometimes combined her own travel experiences with advice on how to run a better airline - both frustrated and amused lawyers and other parties . Late last year , the lawyer for Delta 's pilots union asked Beatty to recuse herself from a contract hearing , charging a prior comment about pilots ' "hideously high " pay showed bias . However , Delta 's lawyers later became frustrated with Beatty as well as she questioned some of the airline 's arguments for needing pay cuts . At one point she loudly told a company lawyer to " shut up , please . " Kathleen Farrell-Willoughby , a court clerk , said Hardin was working with Beatty 's staff Monday , but she did n't know how pending hearings would be rescheduled , including a hearing set for Jan . 19 .

NW	Prime Minister Ariel Sharon showed some improvement on Monday , breathing on his own and moving his right arm and leg a bit as Israeli doctors began bringing him out of a medically induced coma . The process could take days , his doctors said . Members of Sharon 's medical team said they were encouraged by the developments , but emphasized that it was too soon to assess any damage to his brain , and that Sharon 's condition remained " severe and critical . " " This is a very , very gradual process , " said Dr. Felix Umansky , the chief neurosurgeon and leader of the team treating Sharon at Hadassah-Ein Kerem Hospital . " We are just at the beginning of a long way that he needs to go . " The doctors say they believe that Sharon can survive the extensive stroke and cerebral hemorrhage that he suffered Wednesday . But the assumption among Israelis is that Sharon , 77 , will not be able to return to political life . Still , supporters hung a white sheet at the hospital entrance that read , " Ariel Sharon , there is more to do , please wake up . " Sharon has dominated Israeli politics during his nearly five years as prime minister , and the country finds itself in limbo as it heads toward national elections on March 28 . Ehud Olmert , a close ally of Sharon who has been elevated from deputy prime minister to acting prime minister , has pledged to follow Sharon 's policies . He has not made any major decisions since Sharon was hospitalized . Sharon 's new centrist party , Kadima , was heavily favored for the March elections before he suffered his stroke . Opinion polls indicate that Kadima is still ahead of its rivals , though campaigning has effectively been frozen as Israelis hang on each update from Sharon 's doctors . After Sharon was hospitalized , doctors administered sedatives to place him in a coma , and subsequently performed three operations over the next two days to stop the bleeding in his brain . Sharon 's condition stabilized , the doctors said , and on Monday morning they began cutting back on the anesthesia with the aim of drawing him out of the coma . Soon afterward Sharon started breathing on his own , though he remains connected to a respirator as a precaution , the doctors said . " This is the first sign of some sort of activity in his brain , " said Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef , the director of the Hadassah hospital . Later in the day , doctors administered pain-stimulus tests , and Sharon slightly moved his right arm and right leg , Mor-Yosef said . The movements "grew more and more substantial as we reduced the medication , " the doctor added . Sharon 's blood pressure also rose in response to the tests , which the doctor said was a positive sign . However , doctors not involved in Sharon 's care said the movements noted on his right side could not precisely predict what his overall recovery would be . Sharon 's stroke occurred in the right side of his brain , which controls the left side of his body . Left-sided movement , which the doctors did not report on Monday , might still return as the anesthetic is further withdrawn . The medical bulletin made no mention of Sharon 's ability to follow verbal commands , though that step might come later , the independent doctors said . They also said they expected that the stroke would leave Sharon with serious disability . The doctors will continue reducing the anesthesia and looking for additional reactions from Sharon , like his opening his eyes . But Umansky said Sharon was not out of danger . " The moment the prime minister can sit in a chair and speak to us , then we can say he is no longer in serious condition , " Umansky said . (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. ) The Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , said Monday that Palestinian parliamentary elections , planned for Jan . 25 , would take place as scheduled . " The elections will proceed and , God willing , take place on time , " Abbas said in Gaza City . The Palestinian leadership had warned that it might cancel the elections , citing Israel 's threat to prevent voting in East Jerusalem . But Abbas said the United States had provided assurances that Palestinians would be allowed to vote in the eastern part of the city . In a related development , a senior Israeli security official said some Palestinian parties -- but not the militant Hamas , which is fielding candidates -- would be allowed to campaign in East Jerusalem . Gideon Ezra , Israel 's minister for public security , said Palestinians seeking to campaign in East Jerusalem would have to submit a request to the police . Speaking on Israel Radio , Ezra added , " Anyone who is a supporter of Hamas will not receive permission . " Hamas has carried out many of the suicide bombings against Israelis in recent years and calls for Israel 's destruction . Ezra did not say whether Palestinians would be allowed to vote in East Jerusalem , but the decision to permit some campaigning suggested that Israel was likely to allow voting as well . Israel captured the eastern part of the city in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and then annexed it , a move that has not been recognized internationally . The Palestinians claim the eastern sector of Jerusalem as a future capital .
NW	Monday 's suicide bombings at the checkpoint were carried out as revenge for what al-Qaida in Mesopotamia described in an Internet posting as abuses suffered by Sunni Arabs in Interior Ministry prisons , according to the SITE Institute , a group that tracks and translates Islamic Web sites . The posting named the two Iraqi ministers and the U.S. ambassador , Zalmay Khalilzad , saying the attack was a message intended to show that " their barricaded places will not stop the mujahedeen from reaching them . " But the presence of the senior officials appeared to have prevented greater carnage . The police officer who witnessed the attack said the men had approached him , shown him their passes and said they were going to the contracts department inside the ministry . " I said that we have very important visitors , and we cannot let anyone enter , " said the officer , who spoke in an interview from a bed in Kindi Hospital , and declined to give his name out of concern for his safety . One of the bombers was moving about nervously , the officer said , and when a colleague tried to search him , the man took several long steps back , revealing wires underneath his jacket . " My friend told me , run , " the officer said . The police shot at one of the bombers , who blew himself up as they fired , wounding two police officers and killing himself . The second man became lost in the crowd . Several minutes later , an explosion ripped through the people who had gathered around to help . " I felt myself flying through the air and then smashed on the ground , " the officer said , blood on his hand and his legs from shrapnel wounds , his body covered with a blanket . " My friend shouted to me , 'Please hold me ! Please hold me ! " the officer said . " I tried to help him . He was very heavy . I lost consciousness . " As of Monday night , he did not know whether his fellow officer had survived . Among the 16 officers who died were two majors and a colonel , said an Interior Ministry official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press .

NW	I eagerly anticipated the Labor Day weekend last year . As a work-at-home mother with a toddler and a newborn , the idea of a long weekend rendered me giddy . I was looking forward to a few days with nothing more ambitious planned than some walks around the block . Instead , I spent the weekend in an intensive care unit where my husband , Nathan , was in an induced coma . On the Thursday before Labor Day , Nathan came home with a sore throat . Assuming that it was a summer cold , I made him tea with honey . He was able to drink , but he said his throat felt constricted , as though he was choking . After a feverish and sleepless night , Nathan felt worse , but still well enough to work . He asked me to find him a doctor who could check him out in the afternoon , and said goodbye . We had lived in our suburb in New Jersey for just under a year and had yet to find a good primary care physician . By a stroke of luck -- how lucky , I had no idea -- our neighbor was an ear , nose and throat physician . I called his office and left a message . As it was the day before the long weekend , his junior partner called me back . I described Nathan 's tight feeling in his throat , his harsh raspy voice , fever and failed attempts to expectorate . And I remembered that he was having trouble breathing . The doctor insisted that Nathan call immediately . " It sounds like epiglottitis to me , " he said . " But I need to hear his voice to be sure . " After e-mailing Nathan to call the doctor , I did some quick research . Well , it ca n't be epiglottitis , I thought . An inflammation of the cartilage covering the windpipe , the disease is most common in children 2 to 6 , I learned , an age range that Nathan passed about 30 years ago . The cartilage swells rapidly , over a few hours and can cause the airway to close completely , meaning certain and immediate death . Well , that seems like an overzealous diagnosis , I thought . The doctor called back . " I told him to meet me at the emergency room , " he said . " I 'm on duty and I want to take a look at this personally . " Slow day in the ER , I thought . An hour later , Nathan called me from the emergency room . " I need you here . " " I'll be there in about 15 minutes , OK ? " I said distractedly , balancing the telephone between my ear and shoulder as I turned on the coffeemaker . " The babysitter just got here . " " Well , they 're about to intubate me and have me unconscious for a few days , so could you come right away , please ? " he rasped . I drove to the hospital , five minutes away , and ran into the ER . The doctor was there , along with two anesthesiologists , the chief ER surgeon and six nurses . The doctor said that it was in fact epiglottitis and that Nathan 's symptoms were advanced and severe , adding , " If we sedate him and intubate him within the next 10 minutes , the chances of this being fatal are 1 in 100,000 . " The intubation , he said , would ensure that his windpipe would remain open and that Nathan could breathe while being given antibiotics . " And if we do n't ? " " We 'll either have to do a tracheotomy or he 'll die . " Needless to say , we opted for intubation . I felt as if I had been catapulted 50 years into the future . I was not supposed to be in the ER being asked if I had a copy of my husband 's living will . We had a new baby and an "old baby , " not yet 2. Nathan and I said our goodbyes before he went under . The intubation went perfectly , and he was kept in a coma for two days in the intensive care unit until the swelling eased . After coming to terms with the shock , I asked the doctor what had caused his sudden ailment . Epiglottitis is usually caused by Haemophilus influenzae bacteria , he said , but could stem from other bacteria . The doctor said Nathan 's recent traveling and lack of sleep might have left him more susceptible . Because my toddler and I had received the HIB vaccine , we were not at any real risk . The doctor was , however , concerned about the newborn . As a preventive measure , the children and I were placed on an antibiotic so that we could not be carriers for the illness . Nathan 's tube was removed two days later , and he was pronounced cured . He left the hospital just in time to return to work on Wednesday . It was not the best Labor Day weekend . But the fact that we all lived through it was suddenly something to savor .
NW	Cox News Service WEST PALM BEACH , Fla . -- Magnesium consumption through diet and supplements is positively associated with bone density throughout the whole body , particularly in older white adults , according to research published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society . Researchers say the effects are similar to that of calcium . old were asked to complete a questionnaire to determine how much magnesium they were receiving from food and various supplements . Additionally , researchers performed bone mineral density tests on the participants . The study revealed those who ingested more magnesium had significantly higher bone density than those who got the least amount of magnesium . For every 100 milligram per day increase in magnesium intake , data showed a 1 percent increase in bone density . However , this link was only true for the older white men and women . Previous research has demonstrated that black men and women may process vitamin D differently from whites . The recommended daily allowance of magnesium is 320 mg/day for women and 420/mg day for men in this age group . Most people in this age group get far less than this daily amount . Plaque-protein link Researchers at Washington University in St . Louis and the University of Pittsburgh combined high-tech brain imaging with measurement of beta-amyloid protein fragments in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) . They found that greater amounts of beta-amyloid-containing plaques in the brain were associated with lower levels of a specific protein fragment central to Alzheimer 's disease development .

NW	To fans used to paying among the league 's highest ticket prices while griping that Bruins ownership would n't spend the money necessary to win a Stanley Cup , the lower prices signaled a welcome new direction . " It 's nice to see them reaching out , " said Andy Sherman , sitting several rows back from the ice during the game against Toronto . Though some of the jump in attendance resulted from the discounts , ticket sales remained high after they ended . More than 90 percent of season-ticket holders ultimately stayed with the team . Since then , the Bruins have sold about 1,000 new season tickets - triple their sales in the year before the lockout . The Bruins ' increased sales outstrip the NHL as a whole , where attendance through December rose 3.2 percent compared with the last season of hockey . The teams cut prices 7.5 percent on average to $ 41.19 , Team Marketing Report figures show . An NHL spokesman , Frank Brown , said attendance in October and November of this year set records . " It 's literally extraordinary and a clear indication of the passion of our fans that not only did they come back , but in record numbers , " he said . But some Bruins fans , initially excited by the team 's return , already have become jaded . Andries , the fan in the $ 10 seats , bought tickets to every home game this year . He and his friend Gilmore showed up to the games early , stood next to the ice to watch the players ' warm-ups , then bought chicken fingers and beer . When the Bruins began to lose , however , and traded captain Joe Thornton to San Jose , the two friends got so upset that they made themselves bright yellow shirts that read , " Worst management in sports ... it 's called Bruins . " Though the team did win that night , it was only the second time in the previous seven home games . In the sports business , winning teams attract more fans and do better financially . The merchandise store in the Garden reflects this : When the Bruins win , jubilant fans crowd into the store after the games , snapping up anything with the name " Bruins " on it . But if the team loses , "everyone is disappointed , " said Kevin Peterson , a retail associate at the store . " People will keep walking past the store . No one is interested in buying something . " Luxury-suite sales and corporate sponsorships work the same way . Corporations will pay a hefty price for suites in an arena - the average Garden suite goes for $ 250,000 - but only if executives feel the outlay makes business sense . If their clients stop clamoring to see Bruins games , the companies are likely to reassess . Already , in marketing the luxury suites , Garden executives face increasing competition from two winning teams in town , the the Patriots and the Red Sox , who are investing heavily in their own premium seats . As leases for corporate suites at the Garden expire , some companies are not renewing . John Hancock Financial Services , long a supporter of sports in Boston , did not renew its suite at the Garden for the 2006 season as part of a
NW	Recent reports out of Tallahassee paint a rosy picture of the job market in the Tampa Bay area . Like the rest of the state , the area has near-record low unemployment coupled with near-record growth . " This is probably a good year to be looking for a job , " said Bill Dobson , an economic analyst with the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation . But what kind of jobs are they ? When wages and benefits are factored in , the overall quality of those jobs ranks among the poorest in the nation . And therein lies the dilemma . The state is trying to address job quality , but to some , help ca n't come fast enough . Suzanne Block , 22 , graduated last month from the University of South Florida with a bachelor 's degree in bio-medical science and a minor in psychology . She started looking for a job last fall . Of the 10 resumes she sent out , she got one response . " They seemed positive , " she said of the company that contacted her . " Then they asked what experience I had . I told them that so far , my experience is academic . I have n't heard back from them . " With student loans to pay off , Block returns to the classifieds and the Internet each day , searching for a job with an environmental lab or a pharmaceutical company . " But a lot of them do n't want entry-level positions , " she said . " So it 's a classic Catch-22 . How can you get experience if you ca n't get a job ? " She graduated with a 3.75 GPA , and although she has a fairly specific field of study , " It 's not like I went to mortuary school , " she said , "where there 's only one place where I can work . " If her situation does n't improve soon , Block said , she may have to go back to working as a server or a cashier . " I 'm just hoping someone will take a chance on me , " she said . The odds of getting a well-paying job depend on what 's hot , and that has n't changed much in the past several years . For people in the Tampa Bay area looking for work in the education , health care , computer or construction fields , 2006 should be a very good year according to state projections . It 's not a good time to look for work as a telephone operator , word processor or typist , travel agent or in the commercial fishing industry . Despite efforts to bring new industry into the area , much of the growth in new jobs is tied to the same two traditional elements . " Although we try to diversify , " Dobson said , " a lot of our job growth is still driven by population growth and tourism . " That growing population is also rapidly aging . Roughly a quarter of Tampa Bay 's population are baby boomers , people born between 1946 and 1964 , and as they start to retire , they 'll need to be replaced . " However , " Dobson said , "because the next generation of workers to follow the baby boomers is the X generation ( born 1965-1980 ) and is a much smaller number of people , there could possibly be a shortage of workers in some career fields . " One of the hottest jobs in the area right now is engineering , especially civil engineering . Among recent college graduates , those majoring in education , accounting , nursing and physical therapy are also in high demand , said Dr. Drema Howard , director of USF 's Career Center . " We 're also starting to see a demand for technology majors , and that 's a shift from the last three years . " Howard said she saw a drop in the overall job market over the past several years , but that trend is starting to reverse . " For students graduating in 2005 or 2006 , it 's a much stronger market than in the last three or four years , " she said . " The last study we saw indicated employers expected to hire 14 percent more college grads than last year . " There are always jobs out there , she added . " But it 's a job in and of itself to get a job . "
NW	Once every few years , a disaster in a tiny Appalachian town reminds the nation that coal mining remains a dangerous occupation . The cause of the latest incident , which claimed 12 lives at the Sago Mine in West Virginia , is unknown and under investigation . But certain problems are endemic in the industry : old safety equipment , lax enforcement and a get-along culture in which safety complaints are discouraged , according to an examination of government and court records and interviews this past week and over the years with hundreds of miners , dozens of mine inspectors and mine safety experts . Even well-run mines are frightening places . The average Appalachian mine is less than 5 feet high , with some less than 3 feet . Some miners bring straws with their lunches because there is not enough space to tilt a Coke can over their heads . The roof often pings and rumbles like ice on a frozen pond . While a few corporate giants own multiple mines , there are many small companies with only a few mines . These operations are usually nonunion . They use reconditioned equipment and hire unskilled men with few other prospects who often worry that large fines will shut down their mines . " Many miners look at inspectors as their enemies , " said Tony Oppegard , a former top federal mine official in the Clinton administration and the former prosecutor of mine safety violations in Kentucky . Throughout the industry , the oxygen canisters , the telephones , the ventilation equipment and almost every other piece of safety equipment are nearly identical to those used more than 20 years ago . Some mines still produce coal with explosives , a technique that has changed little in 100 years . Mines are routinely cited for violating federal safety rules . Federal inspections occur at least four times a year . Federal inspectors almost never close a mine even when they find repeated instances of life-threatening safety problems . The Sago Mine had 202 safety violations last year , a number that included 16 blatant violations that were considered immediate hazards to miners ' safety . Like Sago , six other underground mines in West Virginia have 100 to 150 employees , according to federal records . Not one of the six had a similar blatant violation last year , according to federal mine records . Sago has had 14 major roof falls since June . Its injury rate last year was three times the national average . Monday , Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia named J. Davitt McAteer , who oversaw the mine safety agency in the Clinton administration , to oversee the work of state and federal investigators and issue a report on last week 's disaster by July 1 . " We will pursue every lead , " McAteer said . " We will take every step necessary to find the problems and to fix those problems . "
NW	You can scroll through them quickly with your mouse 's wheel . Those folks with a lot of media files may be attracted to Windows Vista . The new version of Windows Media Player has been overhauled to improve its performance when managing lots of music files . Folks with thousands of songs know the agony of trying to scroll through the Media Player library . This has been greatly improved , to the point that Microsoft has added the ability to display album art with each song . If art is not attached to a song or album , you can tell Vista to fetch it and associate it with a song . Microsoft also has improved the photo viewer in Vista , giving it the ability to crop and edit photos -- but always keeping a copy of the original . No matter how many times you tweak and fiddle with a photo , the original will still be available to you . I suspect that one of the biggest lures will be Vista 's new look . It has transparent borders , neat window opening-and-closing effects , and more of a 3-D design -- though this will only work if you have a video card that will support it . Those who do not will see a desktop closer to Windows XP 's 2-D design . It also is more customizable . You can resize icons in folders at will , for example , and change the color of title bars . But given Microsoft 's issues with spyware , viruses and flaws , I suspect that its security features will draw the most notice . It will be much more difficult in Vista for spyware to take over your system , as it can now in Windows XP. Windows Vista will require users to enter an administrator password to access certain features , similar to the way the Mac OS X does now . Microsoft Antispyware , the free beta tool now available at www.microsoft.com/antispyware , is built into Vista as Windows Defender . Buried deep within it are advanced features that allow technically savvy users to get lots of information about what programs are talking to the Internet or are set up to launch at startup . And when you install Vista on an existing system , it will scan for spyware and remove it before the process goes forward . Vista also has built-in parental controls that make it very easy to restrict what children can do on a computer , and when . Assigning allowable hours for computer use is as easy as dragging a mouse across a time grid . Vista also can read the Entertainment Software Ratings Board rating on a game and restrict usage to specific ratings . It 's nice having these features built in to the operating system , but compelling ? Not to me . Many of them -- such as desktop search , spyware protection , photo editing , music file organizing -- are already available from other Windows programs , many of them free and more powerful than what Vista offers . Based on using the early beta , the overall experience is positive . But when I switch back to using Windows XP , I find I do n't miss using Vista .
NW	ENGLEWOOD , Colo . - No disrespect intended to Eugene Wilson , but if the Patriots had done a better job selling John Lynch when he visited Foxborough in the offseason two years ago as a free agent , they might have started the season with a Rodney Harrison-John Lynch safety combination . How many receivers would have gotten their blocks knocked off ? " That would have been a lot of fun , and I thought about that a lot at the time , " Lynch said . " I had an opportunity in free agency to visit with both Bill Belichick and Mike Shanahan and came away impressed with both sides . These are the top ones in the league . " There were a number of circumstances involved with my decision . The Patriots certainly impressed me . The Patriots at the time were a little nervous about my neck [which he injured late in the '03 season with Tampa Bay] , and so things just worked out well here . " In the end , there was no reason to be worried about Lynch 's neck . He 's made his sixth and seventh Pro Bowl appearances since the visit and has put a stamp of toughness on a Broncos defense that underwent a major facelift in the offseason . It 's a toughness the Patriots experienced first-hand Oct. 16 when the Broncos got after Tom Brady and everyone else on offense for a 28-20 win after amassing a 28-3 lead . Lynch and Harrison are the two hardest-hitting safeties in the game . The Patriots wo n't have Harrison , who suffered a major knee injury in Week 3. But Lynch has persevered , and he wishes that Harrison was playing Saturday night . " I know him , " said Lynch . " I would n't say I know him well , but I know there 's a genuine respect from me for the way he plays the game . I think he 's one of the great safeties to ever play the game , I really do . I think it shows on the field . " There 's no mistaking that when he 's on the field how much he loves the game and how much passion he has for the game . It 's a shame he ca n't play in this game because it would have been fun to watch him out there . " Harrison has made only two Pro Bowls , which he attributes to being disliked around the league for what was perceived as dirty play when he was younger . Lynch , too , has been fined a lot for big hits , though not as much as Harrison . " He should have made more Pro Bowls , " Lynch said . " As to why he has n't , I do n't know . I do n't know what it is , but I know that a lot of people respect him in this game . I know I certainly do . I think he 's a tremendous player . " Lynch was lighting up Patriots receivers back in October . But he realizes they are a much better team now . " I just think they 're playing great football right now , " he said . " Their defense can play with anyone . A lot of their guys were hurt back when they played us . " When you bring new players in , you kind of have to find your identity , much as we did early in the year because we had a lot of new players . You just have to kind of find what you 're best at . They have a new coordinator [Eric Mangini] , so I 'm sure that took some time to adjust to . " They 've allowed something like 132 yards rushing the last four games . That 's outstanding football . They are the defending champs so there 's nothing but respect coming out of here . " In the first meeting , the Broncos did what few teams have been able to do to Brady - pressure him and get there with big hits before he gets rid of the ball . " We did get a lot of hits on him , and that 's not something a lot of people get to do , " said Lynch . " But we were up , 28-3 , on him and he brought them back . For us , the formula is always to stop the run first and then we can get a few other things going . " The Broncos wound up having to sweat out that win . Lynch knows that if they play the way they did in the second half of that game , they wo n't advance to the next round . " We were kind of struggling with that at that time of the year , " he said . " We were getting big leads on people and then struggling to hang on . I think we 're finishing off better now . " Lynch is no stranger to the postseason , having been a big part of Tampa Bay 's 48-21 win over Oakland in Super Bowl XXXVII , the only Super Bowl won by a team other than New England in the last four years . He 's played for Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden and Shanahan , so he feels he 's been coached by the best . And he feels the best will be going head to head Saturday night . " Playoff experience is as much with the coaches as it is with the players , " Lynch said . " These are two battle-tested playoff coaches . These are guys who have won multiple Super Bowls . " Both teams will be ready to play . Both teams will be well-prepared . When you 're well-prepared , it typically comes down to who is going to execute the best . They 're both brilliant coaches . I really think they are . " Shanahan , however , won the recruiting game . Lynch-Harrison would have been an all-timer .
NW	A previously unrecognized galaxy appears to be merging with the Milky Way , bringing hundreds of thousands of stars into our home galaxy that no one has noticed until now , astronomers announced Monday . A survey of the northern sky has detected a huge , but diffuse structure within the confines of the Milky Way that does not seem to fit in with other parts of the galaxy that contains our solar system . Robert H. Lupton of Princeton University told a meeting of the American Astronomical Society that the large but faint collection of stars rises almost perpendicular to the flat , spiral disk of the Milky Way . The most likely interpretation of the structure , the astronomer said , is that it is a dwarf galaxy that has been merging with our galaxy . The dwarf galaxy lies in the direction of the constellation Virgo at an estimated distance of 30,000 light years from Earth , researchers reported . The Milky Way is a flat , pinwheel galaxy measuring more than 100,000 light years across and containing an estimated 200 billion stars , including the sun , along its long , spiral arms and around the bulge at its center . A light year is the distance light travels in a vacuum in a year 's time , about 6 trillion miles . Astronomers found the merging galaxy through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , a project that for more than five years has been mapping the distance and characteristics of millions of objects in space . The project is operated by a consortium of universities and other institutions and uses a telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico . The latest study , which has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal for publication , shows that the Milky Way still is changing and evolving , said Mario Juric , a Princeton graduate student who is the principal author of the report . " It looks as though the Milky Way is still growing , by cannibalizing smaller galaxies that fall into it , " Juric said in a statement .
NW	Federal prosecutors have charged seven Ku Klux Klan members with running an illegal gun-trading ring to finance a plan to blow up the Johnston County courthouse , according to Johnston County Sheriff Steve Bizzell and federal indictments . Indictments unsealed Monday said the ring 's heyday dates to the winter of 2001 and 2002 , when several Klansmen bartered and sold dozens of stolen firearms . Investigators say they took illegal trade beyond state lines . " This is going to be a detrimental blow to the KKK , " said Bizzell , who said he received a death threat in 2002 from the Benson-based Klan splinter group . " Any time this many members are arrested and part of a criminal enterprise that is meeting and planning to carry out the blowing up of a courthouse and the killing of elected officials , this is serious business . " Federal prosecutors indicted Daniel Leigh Barefoot , 22 ; Sharon Renee Barefoot , 40 ; Jonathan Ashley Avery , 26 ; Jonathan Maynard , 22 ; Marvin Glen Gautier , 53 ; Michael Anthony Brewer , 35 ; and Rossie Lynwood Strickland , 57 , for conspiring to possess and sell stolen firearms . Bizzell said all of those charged were affiliated with the Klan splinter group in southern Johnston County . Several guns were stolen from a gun collector 's home in Benson in 2001 , Johnston Sheriff 's Capt . Buck Pipkin said . According to the indictment , those charged moved the guns between their homes and barns and cleaned the guns to remove fingerprints . Customers stashed cash payments in Brewer 's mailbox , the indictment said . This is the latest set of charges stemming from an investigation begun four years ago after the group tried to march in a parade at Mule Days in Benson . Bizzell said he expects additional charges soon . Charles Robert " Junior " Barefoot , former grand dragon of the North Carolina chapter of The National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , split off in 2001 and formed the Nation 's Knights of the Ku Klux Klan . Charles Barefoot , along with three others charged Monday , is behind bars awaiting trial in the 2003 slaying of Lawrence Arthur Pettit of Jacksonville , allegedly another Klan member whose decomposed body was found in a Sampson County field . Federal prosecutors charged Charles Barefoot again last summer with possessing a pink gel-like explosive in the freezer of his Benson home in 2002 . Investigators would n't say why the charges Monday were brought so long after 2002 , when dozens of weapons were seized from Barefoot 's Benson home . The sheriff alleged then that Barefoot may have been plotting to blow up several county offices . In an unrelated case about the same time , Charles Barefoot was accused of assaulting his wife , Sharon Renee Barefoot , with a deadly weapon . Daniel L. Barefoot is Charles Barefoot 's son . Bizzell said the current investigation "was much more involved than we initially realized . "

Both he and the Bushies owe Bill Clinton big time as far as I can see , since CLinton 's negotiators at the meetings that worked out the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court were , as far as I know , among those responsible for seeing to it that the Statute does not contain a working definition of `` War of Aggression '' : with the crime undefined , Blair cannot be indicted at the Hague for his conspiring with Bush & Co to launch an unprovoked attack on , and invasion of , another country .

" Meanwhile , Carolyn Tate and Maizie Harris Jesse ( Nevada Appeal ) note : " Thirty-nine years ago in March , the horrible incident at Mai Lai in Vietnam occurred . When Lt . William Calley was court martialed , he insisted he was just following orders . Remarks were made at the time that he should have disobeyed and refused to kill civilians . Now they are trying to court martial Lt . Ehren Watada for refusing to deploy to Iraq . Lt . Watada has said he will go to Afghanistan and fight , but not Iraq , because he believes it to be an 'illegal ' war ( we agree ) . Double standard ? Is it his Mai Lai ? Or is he derelict for not following orders ? Think about it . " Yesterday on The KPFA Evening News , Aaron Glantz reported on the army 's decision to refile charges against Ehren Watada last Friday . Eric Seitz , Watada 's civilian attorney , stated , " It is my professional opinion that Lt . Watada cannot be tried again because of the effects of double-jeopardy . . . . Once jeopardy has attached and it clearly did attach in this case when the jury panel was sworn in and when the first witness testified the protection against double-jeopardy applies as a Constitutional matter . " Jeff Paterson ( Courage to Resist , Not In Our Name ) told Glantz : " The military wanted to avoid showing to all the other people , all the other troops who are facing 2nd and 3rd and 4th deployments to Iraq is that if you do n't go to Iraq and you speak out , you 'll have a thousand people rally to your defense , pay all your legal bills , Sean Penn will hang out with you and [you will ] go to prison for a few months or do you go to Iraq ? And I think some people would go for that deal of the public support and spending a few months in prison instead of Iraq . " Glantz also noted that Mark Wilkerson was sentenced to seven months last Thursday and that he will be imprisoned until September (unless he is released early ) .( Glantz ' report also aired on yesterday 's Free Speech Radio News ) . This month is an anniversary as well . First Coast News ' Shannon Ogden noted : " This month is also the anniversary of Camilo Mejia 's release from military prison . " Mejia was released on February 15 , 2005 . Mejia self-checked out of the military after serving in Iraq and received a one-year sentence . Odgen spoke with Camilo Mejia who states , " You know , I could n't really justify , I 'd say , 90 percent of the things we did in Iraq . " He also offers that " the entire invasion lacked authority . . . it was not in response to an attack on the US. " Echoing the issue Tate and Harris Jesse raised above , Mejia noted , " In the military , we have a duty to refuse an order that we know is illegal . " He also notes , " Absolutley . And I do feel like a coward but not for not going back but for going in the first place . Because I knew the war was wrong from the beginning . " Odgen mentioned that Mejia will soon begin a lecture tour behind his upcoming autobiography . That book is Road from ar Ramadi : The Prviate Rebellion of Staff Sergeant Camilo Mejia -- due out May 1st , from The New Press , with an afterword written by Chris Hedges .
WB	March 1 , 2007 . Chaos and violence continues in Iraq , Sara Rich continues fighting for her daughter , the US military is obsessed with Kyle Snyder , and Walter Reed Medical Center was such a disaster that Joyce Rumsfeld was raising flags ( wife of Donald Rumsfeld ) . On NPR 's Morning Edition today , it was noted that month of February started as ended -- with bombings of Iraqi markets . AFP notes the (undercount ) by the Iraqi ministries of February deaths -- 1,646 -- and notes that the hard-sell is "down eight percent " from January but the reality is " [t]he figure is still vastly higher , however , than the 548 people killed in February 2006" . The month was also marked by rapes . Dahr Jamail and Ali al-Fadhily ( IPS) examine the reaction ( or Nouri al-Maliki 's non-reaction ) to the gang rape of Sabrine al-Janabi , the 20 year-old woman who came forward last week , as well as the 50-year-old woman that followed her -- both women were gang-raped by Iraqi security forces and Ahmed Mukhtar tells IPS , " The Iraqi police are following the examples of those who trained them . American soldiers did it more than a thousand times and got away with it . They sentenced that soldier who killed Abeer after rpaing her with a hundred years imprisonment , but we Iraqis are not fools , and we know he will be on parole sooner than he hopes . " Dahr spoke with Nora Barrows-Friedman about this topic on KPFA 's Flashpoints Tuesday and noted that the rapes are receiving more media attention in the Arab world than in the US media . If the goal is to uninform the American public , corporate media take your bow . Turning to the topic of war resisters , Jessica Hegdahl (UCD Advocate ) references MLK ( " War is a poor chisel for carving out a peaceful future . " ) and sees the continuation of peace in Ehren Watada : " There 's a radical solution to the problem of Iraq . It lies in the simple observation that 'to stop an illegal and unjust war , the soldiers can choose to stop fighting it . ' These words were spoken by Lt . Ehren Watada , the first commissioned officer to resist deployment to Iraq , facing up to four years in jail . Every soldier , commissioned or enlisted , who opposes the war in Iraq must eventually decide between his conscience and his orders . When your country is ordering you to complete an illegal and immoral act , are you not obliged to refuse ? It would be far better for the members of our military to refuse to deploy , face imprisonment or other punishment , than to obey their contracts with the United States military , which allow for the killing of innocent Iraqis . " Ehren Watada , in June of last year , became the first officer to refuse to deploy to Iraq . A three-day court-martial took place at the start of this month but Judge Toilet called a mistrial over the objections of the defense and , last Friday , the military refiled charges against him . Gregg K. Kakesako ( Honolulu Star-Bulletin ) reports that the pretrial motions are currently set for May 20th with the court-martial scheduled " for July 16-20 . " Justin Ward ( Austin Chronicle ) weighs in on war resister Mark Wilkerson who was court-martialed and sentenced last Thursday ( to seven months in prison ) and notes that Ann Wright ( " a former Army colonel and State Department official who resigned in protest of the Iraq war " ) spoke to a gathering of Wilkerson supporters the Wednesday before his court-martial : " They are the ones that are willing to put their bodies on the line -- not on the line for murdering or criminal activity but on the line for conscience and morality and to hold accountable an administration that is putting our nation at risk .

WB	" Well yes , Mr. President Bush , former Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai did believe that drinking your own urine improved your health , but , I do n't know , yours smells kind of funny . Less like urine and more like Uribe . " P.S. I 'm not making that shit up about Morarji Desai and the urine-drinking . I met him once when he was PM at age 7 , got to shake his hand , and found out later that he drank his own pee . I was one grossed out 7-year-old and took to OCD hand washing behavior for like a month . P.P.S. Since ethanol ( sugarcane ) and my childhood year in India seem to have come together , I hope you 'll forgive me for reminiscing a moment about the sugarcane juice stands in India back in 1977 . They had stacks and stacks of raw fresh-cut sugar cane and a press . You would pay them your five or ten paise ( 100 paise to a rupee--I got a four-rupee a week allowance , spoiled little brat that I was )and they run the sugar cane through the press , letting the juice pour into a little glass , which they would then hand to you . Oh . My . God . Sweeeeeet , sweeeeeeeeeet sugarcane juice ! So much better than candy . There was a sugarcane juice stand two bus stops before my home on the way home from school and I risked parental wrath for that nectar every single time I had the requisite paise ! Anyone that lives in NYC can check out the same glories by heading out to the Bronx , where I noticed , upon last visit , that Jamaican street vendors have set up similar stands ( although I imagine the cane is not quite as fresh ) . P.P.P.S. Yes , I know urine does n't come close to rhyming with Uribe , but was too taken with the recent scandal ( not that it 's a surprise ) linking Uribe to death squads that are engaged in trafficking a substance that Bush reportedly used to take to like , well , like a seven-year-old to sugarcane juice . ...And yes , I do realize that if a joke requires that much explanation , it 's not very funny
WB	Brazil and the United States are the two largest democracies by population in our hemisphere . Polite Canadians will simply make that mental edit and have no need to write even a mildly cross letter . ( Though they may write one regarding the stereotypical use of "eh" . ) The other thing that the United States and Brazil have in common is that they both clung to slavery far longer than any of the countries around them . Brazil was the major destination of the African slave trade . So this much-vaunted "democracy " was of course only for a portion of the population . ( Yes , there 's also the question of women 's suffrage happening even later , but let 's stick with one injustice at a time ) . Slavery in Brazil actually ties in nicely with the "alternative fuel " aspect of the story ; slaves were used extensively in the cultivation of sugar cane . And now we can come full circle , devoting agricultural crops to feeding rich people 's energy-guzzling habits , so that black people will suffer . Ok , not all who will die of hunger as a result will be African , but quite a few will be .

WB	Today , Bush went to a Ford assembly plant in Missouri at which they make hybrid SUVs and suchlike . Iâve always assumed that Bushâs grammar is so bad in part because he never actually listens when other people speak and thereby learns how English am to be spoken , but mostly because heâs lazy and sloppy and canât think two words ahead . From this speech , for example , âit makes sense for us to promote that kind of technologiesâ  and âitâs now becoming in the marketplaceâ  and âin a relatively quick period of time .â  Sloppy .

Simple pleasures for simple minds : â I enjoyed walking up and down the line , shaking peopleâs hands .â  He said that one way to reduce gas use 20 % in 10 years â  â I call it Twenty Tenâ  â  is âto encourage consumption of hybrid automobiles .â  Theyâre delicious with steak sauce . Although theyâre not exactly âzero emissions ,â  if you know what I mean . He wisely informed the plant workers , âRemember , oil is the feedstock for gasoline .â  âIt may sound far-fetched to some that one of these days weâll be making a product that can go into a Ford pickup truck out of wood chipsâ . Wait , is the fuel made out of wood chips , or the pickup truck ? He finds himself sooooo interesting : âItâs really interesting , is nât it , for the President to be talking about one of these days people driving pickup trucks driven by ethanol -- fueled by ethanol from wood chips ?

WB	In a true meeting of the repellant minds , Dick âDickâ  Cheney was interviewed by Rush Limbaugh , who invited him to attack the Democrats about Iraq . Cheney laudably refrained from doing so for several long microseconds : âIâve got some friends on the other side of the aisle , and I donât want to question everybodyâs motives -- I do believe that a significant portion of the Democrats , including , I think , Nancy Pelosi , are adamantly opposed to the war and prepared to pack it in and come home in defeat , rather than put in place or support a policy that will lead to victory .â  Support a policy . But what else must they support ?

Thatâs just a non-sensical statement .â  Again , supporting the troops means everything theyâre ordered to do . Anything else is just non-sensical . Also non-sensical : Nancy Pelosiâs attempt to mediate between Israel and Syria : âIt was a non-statement , non-sensical statement and did nât make any sense at allâ . You know , Cheney pretends to despise Nancy Pelosi , but he reveals his true feelings when he describes a visit from her as a reward : âSheâs not entitled to make policy . In this particular case , by going to Damascus at this stage , it serves to reinforce , if you will , and reward Bashir Assad for his bad behavior . ... This is a bad actor , and until he changes his behavior , he should not be rewarded with visits by the Speaker of the House of Representatives .â  He just seethes with jealousy . Nancy never rewards him with a visit . âIâm obviously disappointed .

WB	Media Matters points out that while Bush in his immigration speech this week claimed that the decrease in arrests of illegal border-crossers proved that his policies have been effective â  â When you âre apprehending fewer people , it means fewer are trying to come acrossâ  â  in a November 2005 speech he cited increased arrests as proof of his policiesâ  effectiveness . If you âre wondering , yes , if arrests neither increased nor decreased , that would also show that his policies were working . Secretary of War Robert and the always alliterative Peter Pace held a press conference about extending deployments from their current 12 months to 15 months , effective immediately . Gates explained that this policy would âgive greater clarity and fairness .â  Assuming your idea of clarity and fairness is to be stuck an additional 3 months in Iraq or Afghanistan while hostile locals shoot clearly and fairly at your ass . Pace says that the increased length of combat will also increase quality of... quality of... quality of what now ? â[ T]hey will have a predictable life ; that they can sit there around the dinner table and know that on calendar month so - and-so , daddyâs going to leave , and on calendar month so-and-so , mommyâs going to come home , and those kinds of things , which add to quality of life .â  And yes , that âs assuming mommy does nât come home a little bit earlier in a body bag . And that the Pentagon does nât change its mind again , as Gates pointed out with clarity and fairness : âThat does not mean that something could not happen tomorrow that would cause our nation to need more of our armed forces to go do something different .â  Maverick John âMaverickâ  McCain the Maverick gave a speech about Iraq at the Virginia Military Institute today ( Note : link is to the prepared remarks ) . He said of his trip to Baghdad , â Unlike the veterans here today , I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps .â  That explains the body armor and military escort : he was afraid of an attack by Helen Thomas . Well , fair enough . He tried to portray himself as a realist about Iraq . He distanced himself from âfalse optimism ,â  saying that he preferred to offer âersatz optimism .â  Okay , he did nât . He said , â I took issue with statements characterizing the insurgency as a few âdead-endersâ  or being in its âlast throes .ââ  Sure you did , John . Youâll notice heâs willing to criticize the false optimism of Rumsfeld or Cheney but not that of Bush . Much of the speech was spent impugning the motives of politicians who oppose the war for seeking âthe expediency of easy but empty answers ,â  âthe allure of political advantage , â  and âthe temporary favor of the latest public opinion poll , â  and for engaging in âfanciful and self-interested debatesâ  and âgiddy anticipation of the next election .â  Someone needs to ask him if itâs only Democratic politicians who are being base and cynical , or if that also applies to the majority of Americans who oppose the war . âBefore I left for Iraq , I watched with regret as the House of Representatives voted to deny our troops the support necessary to carry out their new mission . Democratic leaders smiled and cheered as the last votes were counted . What were they celebrating ? Defeat ? Surrender ? In Iraq , only our enemies were cheering .â  He did say one thing that I entirely agree with : âIf fighting these people and preventing the export of their brand of radicalism and terror is not intrinsic to the national security and most cherished values of the United States , I donât know what is .â  I agree : you donât know what is .

WB	Information on war resistance within the military can be found at Center on Conscience & War , The Objector , The G.I. Rights Hotline , and the War Resisters Support Campaign . Courage to Resist offers information on all public war resisters . Al Jazeera reports on Abu Fares who left Iraq with his family but returned after the start of the illegal war in 2003 which he felt was cause for hope and return ( the disposing of Saddam Hussein ) only to discover that " Everything was chaos . We spent days with no water or electricity . I had to write my will every time I wanted to leave the house . " The family has now returned to Iran with no plans to return to Iraq . The issue of refugees is one that Dahr Jamail and Ali al Fadhilly have reported on at length for IPS and Dahr has also reported on it frequently for Flashpoints . Last Tuesday , on Flashpoints , Dahr spoke with Emily Howard about the refugee problem and the refusal to address it by it the US. He noted that those fortunate enough to afford to leave ( buying their way out of arrests frequently ) become internal refugees ( wandering or living in refugee tents ) or else the become external refugees who leave the country . Friday on KPFA 's The Morning Show , Dahr spoke with Andrea Lewis and Aaron Glantz about the Iraqi refugees who had gone to Syria and noted , " I have updated numbers from meeting with Sybella Wilkes yesterday who is the UNHCR regional public information officer . And according to UNHCR , there are , there 's 1.2 million is the minimum estimate they have in Syria alone . The governement of Syria , who UNHCR admitted probably has more accurate figures than they do , estimates there 's between 1.4 and 1.5 million Iraqi refugees here , hundreds of thousands of those are Shia as well . I think people in the US are led to believe that it 's only the Sunni population that 's leaving and , while they are the majority , it 's important to note that there 's a giant number and growing number of Shia up here in Syria as well . But really the situation is really -- even just those numbers , as if they 're not staggering enough by themselves -- the situation here is UNHCR has only actually registered approximately 70,000 of these people . So that means these are only the 70,000 that literally have so little of anything that they have to literally go there for food and in some way to find some housing . So the crisis is certainly going to grow exponentially as these other Iraqis here , and I have met with many of them , are living on their savings right now . What are they going to do when their savings run out ? Syria right now has approximately a 20 to 25 % unemployment rate . Add in another between 1.2 to 1.5 million Iraqis , so already that figure is too low . And as time persists , of course , the situation will worsen . And we have between 30 and 50,000 more Iraqis coming into Syria alone every single month . " [ Those unable to listen to the broadcast can click here for that and other remarks by Dahr. ]
